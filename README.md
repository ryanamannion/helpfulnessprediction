Final Project for LING472 - Computational Linguistics
with Advanced Python

Spring 2020

---
The purpose of this project is to predict the helpfulness scores of
reviews left on online marketplaces. Given a review and certain other
metadata, can we engineer features that allow us to accurately predict a
review's helpfulness without the need for users to vote?
