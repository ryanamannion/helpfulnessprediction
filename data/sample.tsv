560571	B000CQID1K	A5OEMGI2Q70V0	M. Rocha "Prime Rocks!"	3	3	2	1196553600	Bursting with goo....	I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra "oomph" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese.

Its slightly sweet scent is not that "Hawaiian Tropic" tourist scent; this is very nice and subtle.  The oil is absorbed rather quickly into my skin so that it's never slippery.  Quick shipping.  Thanks!

Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She "cautiously" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says "You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and "no way!" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage "dining room". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his "Happy" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to "shop around" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne

He absolutely loves them! I love that they are organic (obviously) and that they come in packs of 2. I never leave the house without throwing a pack in our backpack - they've saved me from many meltdowns!<br />Could they pose a choking hazard? Yes. But I have never had an issue and he eats at least 3 of these a week. As with any snack, you have to watch your baby like a hawk. Mine has not choked once.

I have tried to stay off of sugar and white refined things for years but giving up the occasional sweet delights was hard.  This amazing "smart sugar" has changed my life and brought better health and freedom.  Not only have I been able to stabilize my blood sugar which is critical for my weight control and all disease for that matter as Jorge Crews so succinctly presented in his best seller, The Belly Fat Cure, but I have found that substituting Sweet Matters xylitol crystals for sugar in all recipes has completely stopped newly developing joint pain.  Since xylitol, unlike sugar, does not stimulate my pancreas to release insulin and is alkalizing in my system instead of acid producing like sugar,it has been a huge factor in keeping the inflammatory process at bay in my body. Oh yes, this smart sugar is huge in Europe and been the healthy alternative for years. Not only is it not bad for me but it has many health giving benefits. Got to love it!!!

98940	B005QRPH78	A392P34QSBUICZ	Robin Landry "Robin Landry"	0	0	5	1320364800	Daisy likes them	I give 5 stars to anything my dog likes because she's so picky.  People will give her a doggy snack/biscuit and she'll let it drop out of her mouth and onto the ground. So embarrassing.  When I first gave her one of the Zoe Low Calorie chew sticks, she trotted off with it and then laid it down, seemingly forgotten.  I was was ready to say she didn't like them, but, when I gave the stick back to her during her brushing(I have give her something to chew on so she doesn't chew on me), she gobbled it up, and in fact, it took 3 sticks to get through her half hour brush-out(she's a rough collie, like Lassie).<br /><br />Though  Zoe treats are low calorie, something my dog doesn't have to worry about, they still apparently taste good.  They smell like doggy-treat with cinnamon to me, nothing I'd want to eat, but then I'm not the one testing the product.<br /><br />These treats are gluten-free, something I watch out for with my dog because collies are prone to skin problems.  The ingredients are as listed:<br />Brown rice flour<br />organic quinoa flour, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch(I've heard this is good in prevent cancer)oat fiber, oat groats, chicken, natural chicken flavor, calcium carbonate, organic flaxseed, carrots, chia seed, cinnamon, carrogeenan, furtooligosachride(A natural probiotic found in bananas), L-carnitrine(helps turn fat into energy).<br /><br />With all this good stuff going on, I wish the kids were still young enough to get them to eat these sticks.  It would be a whole lot healthier than most of the human snacks out there.  And they were never as picky as Daisy.

My only complaint is when you open the can there is a gell similar to when you open a can of Spam, which has to be scraped off and you lose some dog food because of the space taken by the gel.

I also love the Capuccino and Latte - definitely coffee house coffee at home.  And everyone I've made if for has agreed that it is fabulous!<br /><br />I've read the reviews and I think people don't follow instructions or know what they are doing.  This has one pod - it has no milk pod.  You put it in, set the machine on the correct number of bars corresponding to what is on the pod, and push the button.  Viola.  It is done.  And if there is a milk pod (like for the latte) you use BOTH a milk and a coffee pod not just the milk pod.<br /><br />You will love this coffee and machine!

(and Kosher)	I recently purchased a Keurig machine and wasn't cure what kind of K-cups I should get.<br />I didn't want to commit to a large box of one flavor because<br />A. I like variety and B. What if I didn't like the flavor?<br /><br />So, despite many awful reviews, I decided to take a risk and order this project.<br />And like the title says, I was pleasantly surprised!<br />The product came in a rectangular box, not the paper bag many reviewers were offended by, and the K-Cups were nicely organized inside.<br />I received a wide variety of K-Cups from different companies. While many of them were vanilla or caramel, even those came in a variety of blends and companies.<br />Also included were several cappuccino K-Cups, which I didn't even know existed.<br />Additionally, considering it was fall, I received two Pumpkin Spice K-Cups - Yum!<br />2 Brooklyn Maple Sleigh<br />2 Brooklyn Hazelnut<br />2 Brooklyn Vanilla Skyline<br />1 Green Mountain Mocha Nut Fudge<br />1 Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />2 Green Mountain Island Coconut - Limited Edition<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla Decaf<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />1 Green Mountain Hazelnut Decaf<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla Iced Coffee<br />1 Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette<br />1 Green Mountain Caramel Creme Vanilla<br />2 Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice - Limited Edition<br />1 Green Mountain Southern Pecan<br />2 Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino - Dairy<br />2 Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino - Dairy<br />2 Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino- Dairy<br />2 Kahlua Original<br />1 Gloria Jean's Mudslide<br />1 Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme<br />1 Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee<br />1 Gloria Jean's Hazelnut<br />1 Wolfgang Puck Jamaica Me Crazy<br />1 Donut Shop Collection Cinnamon Roll<br />1 Donut Shop Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut<br /><br />As well as a couple others that I have already drank and don't recall which they were.<br /><br />Overall I was very pleased with the variety I received and none of the included cups were expired, damaged or dried out in any way.<br />Would definitely order again and suggest it to others!<br /><br />P.S.

Most of them are very thick with some smaller sized mixed in.  Love that they are grass fed and hormone/antibiotic free. This is EXTREMELY important to me!!! The length was near perfect on every one. The smell was minimal. My dog loved them and I recently purchased more. The price is out of this world!!!! I was paying over $7.00 for one, locally. Great product, great price, great value!

Constant yeast infections in his ears, skin problems, general stinky dog problems.  After taking him to the vet for like the 100th time for steroids and a super-duper ear washing at the cost of $278, I finally decided to research a better solution.  I found that my dog could be allergic to corn or chicken and it would be best to cut that out of his food all together.  I found this brand at Petco and ever since we went to this vegetarian formula he has been *basically* allergy free!!  He's like a whole different dog!!!  Clear eyes, clear skin, lost a bunch of weight, runs around with his brother like they were puppies all over again, doesn't smell and hasn't needed to go back to the vet for his ears!!!  My doggy loves this food and I love that he's finally healthy.

I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.

368177	B000FCI6K4	A276LD2WGNM18M	Ms. Alice A. Gless	0	0	4	1345852800	I had no idea what to expect but wanted to try it	I read how to make rose water and have plenty of rose petals in the spring but it sounded like too much hassle although I would like to make some candied rose petals because they are very expensive online.  Like others said, just a few drops or it tastes soapy.  I think you have to get accustomed to the new (for me) flavor.  The amount is generous and is not the same as rose water, more concentrated.  I made a Middle Eastern cake that was marbled pink and yellow, rose and almond flavors that complement each other if you don't get too much of one or the other.  I will try to find my photo.  After I got used to it, I liked the taste.  Some time later I used it I think I improvised a corn starch pudding and it was too strong.  I want to try a few drops in my Kittencal's Bakery frosting next time I get inspired.  Anyway, there's a generous amount in the bottle so it will last a long time unless you use it commercially.  Seller and delivery, no problem; I'm usually not in too much of a hurry.  Rose ice cream, divinity, all kinds of things I could try with it.  There is another Middle Eastern recipe I found for Raspberry and Turkish Delight Semifreddo that looks so yummy, will be hard to assemble all the ingredients and get it right.

32100	B0009F3SAK	A3OQNWCOITZSSH	Jaq	2	2	4	1336089600	Better taste than expected	I wanted this tea for the detoxification properties but was wary of what the taste would be like. I really despise licorice and was concerned that this may be overly strong due to all the herbs. This is a very sweet, very balanced and smooth tea. I'm not crazy about the taste but I can drink it every day with ease. The licorice is more of a sweetness than it is a flavor. It starts out a little peppery and is backed by strong sweetness and light floral notes. It tastes better warm than cold.

They are a bit small, but I feel confident when I give them to him that he is getting a relatively healthy snack to which he will not have an allergic reaction.  (He broke out in mild hives when given a Nutragrain cereal bar.)  He enjoys them, and they are a good go-to snack when we are short on time.
118216	B002QTWUEC	A15N2MIY430ZCW	Helen J. Casper	1	1	5	1235520000	Delicious and great for kids!	In my ongoing effort to provide healthy snacks to the children in my son's class (he goes to a public elementary school), I try various organic finger foods. One of the things that has boggled my mind is the amount of graham crackers that contain trans fat- and they are marketed as healthy! When I saw these, I was pleasantly surprised- I didn't imagine I'd see an organic AND trans fat free graham cracker product.<br /><br />Not only are these free of trans fats AND high fructose corn syrup (which is typical of organic products, thankfully) but they are absolutely delicious. I love snacking on them and the kids in my son's class loved them! I went ahead and used the subscribe-and-save feature for this product and now his class has a steady supply of healthy and yummy snacks. :)
524101	B004JGQ15E	A6HOWM08PLFZ5	Michelle Rayburn	0	0	4	1304553600	Yum! A great purse-sized snack.	These are a great snack for when you need something sweet, yet portion controlled. At 130 calories per pack, it isn't too bad considering it satisfies a chocolate craving. And they have only 3 grams of fat per bag. They don't have any significant fiber or other nutrients, but they're better on calories than most snacks.<br /><br />I liked how classy they looked with the chocolate drizzled over the caramel corn. It made them seem more like candy than popcorn. It's a good thing they are portioned in single serve bags, or it would be easy to eat too much!<br /><br />The only drawback is that there are only 6 packages in a box and they might be a little pricey for a snack. However, if you think of them purchasing candy in a single serve pack, then it isn't so bad.

I was shocked at how tasty it was and it was more than $10 cheaper on Amazon than at my local grocery store.  However, when considering the fat and calorie information, note that the serving size is 1/4 cup and many other granola packages are based on 1/2 cup servings.
346097	B004TJF3BE	AVN7MSCXVXEMO	DragonFire1024	1	1	3	1326931200	Not that bad	I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but this product really isn't that bad. There really isn't an after taste and not as intense as I thought it would have been as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The flavor is not amazing, but not bad either. I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the "natural" and "real" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable).

I had every one searching for them even my family up North and no luck. I had to search for them and found them on Amazon so I bought a whole case. They are so good on salads and in soups, since I bought these I use no other croutons. I even sent my Mother some up North and she also loves them. I would die if I didn't have these croutons...LOL I'm set now for months.

I gave it one star because you can't give it minus five stars<br /><br />Cats were sleeping under a bush in my yard on hot afternoons.  I applied a lot of granular Critter Ridder.  It had absolutely no effect on the cats.  I finally removed the bush.  I have a skunk who digs a hole under my fence every night to get into my yard.  I applied a thick layer of the product on his "digging area".  He dug right through it the first night.  I applied more Critter Ridder.  He dug through it again.  He still visits nightly.

The sauce is light, creamy, 'customizable', and very tasty.  About a week ago, I decided to try out the deluxe macaroni and cheese dinner by Annie because the subscribe and save price was slightly cheaper and possessed roughly the same amount of product.  To be frank, the sauce is completely different.  I am not sure how the recipe for the cheese sauce can vary so much between these two products, but I definitely taste a significant difference.  The deluxe cheese sauce tastes overly artificial and more like cheese whiz compared to that of the original version.  Perhaps the variance can be attributed to the fact that the deluxe version's sauce comes pre-made in a packet, whereas the regular version's sauce may be customized to your individual taste by tinkering with the amounts of butter/margarine and milk.  Either way, I am going back over to the regular GF Annie's macaroni dinner (it earns a  five star rating in my opinion!).

I bought a few of these Nongshim noodle soups because they're easy to store and very handy for making a quick lunch on busy days. The latest I tried today was the Savory Bowl Noodle Soup, Chicken Flavor (3.03 ounces). It was quite good, much better than many other brands I've had in the past. The broth was particularly good. Very tasty. My reservations for food dishes such as this is the high sodium content. The soup doesn't taste particularly salty, but the nutrition label says a lot. I counter this by not having such dishes very often. However, if you're going to have these bowls now and then, this is quite a good one, the best I can remember.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

It's not my first choice, as I can tell it is obviously very sweet.  I think that's the selling point.  It actually tastes sweeter than the amount of sugar it contains -- 13 grams per 1 cup serving.  Yes, that's sweet, but I've seen cereals with more than that.<br /><br />I don't think it tastes like s'mores at all, just generic sweet chocolaty cereal with dehydrated marshmallows.  Not bad at all, but I can't have too much for all the sweetness.<br /><br />My kids like it and I don't object too much.  At least it's fortified.

I, foolishly, purchased the 96 count offering, so now I have about 91 cups of coffee that I will not enjoy to the the fullest.

I use it all the time for things like risotto, as a substitute for water on regular rice for more flavor, in sauces and stir fry's, etc. It felt like every time I was making a trip to the grocery store I had to remember to pick up more stock, particularly chicken stock since I seem to go through it much faster than other types of stock. This stock is great tasting with good ingredients. The packaging is good and convenient to use. The size is just about perfect for most things and you can refrigerate what you don't use for a couple of days. The quantities that a standard order contain don't overwhelm you with too much of it, but is enough that I just order a couple of these every few months and keep some in storage.<br /><br />Buy it if you use stock in your cooking on a regular or semi-regular basis (and you might find you use it a lot more if you have it on hand).<br />Don't buy it if you don't cook that much or are a vegetarian or something.

I've just recently started using liquid stevia (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3JY">SweetLeaf SteviaClear Liquid Stevia, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>) to sweeten iced teas, lemonades and other juices that I make at home, and while it is not sugar, it still has a pleasing taste once you learn how much a beverage needs.<br /><br />I saw these on the shelf at my local supermarket the other night and decided to take the plunge. What a waste of $4.99: This stuff is awful! The cola is sweet, yes, but it has a horrible aftertaste, not anything like the liquid stevia that I am used to using, and tastes a lot like drinking black pepper.<br /><br />Just for the record: I don't mind diet cola, and will drink lots of it if it is on hand. I find regular cola a bit sweet for my tastes, but I am a fan of the cane sugar colas that have gotten popular recently. This stuff is expensive, and doesn't even taste much like cola, even if you were to disregard the aftertaste. I might give one of the other flavors a try, but imo it's not worth the expense.<br /><br />I'd say save your money.
71547	B003BK0DX0	A23X7ROANA5ZST	Audiophilereviewing	0	0	5	1336867200	Great treat	At 18 calories per stick, and only a single grain source (rice), these are great treats. Dogs love them. However, please be aware these treats do not contain probiotics like the company claims. Instead they contain a PREbiotic, fructooligosaccharides, which is still beneficial. Fructooligosaccharide is a natural sweetener and helps 'feed' the flora already existing inside a dog's intestines. This is great, but the dog needs gut flora in the first place. If your dog has a damaged digestive system (for example, from antibiotic usage) then the fructooligosaccharides won't be too beneficial.<br /><br />Compared to similar products and prices, this is a great product for a great price.

453434	B0029XLH4Y	A150Y6RN6CVLN3	C. Taylor	1	2	2	1287187200	Passable, but muddy	NOTE: This is a review of this coffee in the K-cup format, not of Amazon's packaging.  However, I have never had trouble with the Frustration-free packaging; I simply cannot comment in this case.<br /><br />Reviewer's preferences: Strong, medium-dark roast coffees, mid-to-heavily sweetened with whole milk (4:1 ratio or a little heavier toward the coffee side).  I occasionally add a hint of vanilla syrup and cream or half-and-half if a coffee is overly bitter.<br /><br />I picked up this coffee in a large sampler box of Coffee People "Extra Bold" K-cups, which I have just finished off.  The collection contained the following blends/coffees: Wake-up Call, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, and Organic.  I have had each coffee multiple times.  From the four, I give the Organic blend the top spot with a slight edge over Black Tiger (we're talking 9.1/10 over 9.0/10 here).  Both the Black Tiger and Organic were strong and bold in flavor but not too bitter, while the Wake-up Call tended to be a little more harsh on the palate.  The Jet Fuel blend was appropriately named, as it almost always required a little vanilla and more milk or even heavy cream to make it palatable.<br /><br />Qualities of Coffee People Jet Fuel:<br />Dark, almost burned coffee flavor (think bad Sumatran roast).  Heavy bitterness that overwhelms the flavor, harsh on the back of the tongue and a fully bitter aftertaste, but probably drinkable if you are a fan of Sumatran or French Roast coffees.  Medium acidity, a little tangy but not really sour, with an earthy flavor that tends toward muddy.  Flavor envelops the entire mouth, but generally overwhelms the palate.  Heavy body, but not sludgy, though your mouth may be convinced otherwise from the flavor.  While I can and sometimes do drink other coffees black (mostly full-bodied medium roasts), I can't imagine anyone drinking this black even if they take their espresso that way.  Requires sweetener and cream/half-and-half or a heavy addition of milk.  Personally, I had to use a small splash of vanilla syrup to hide the bitterness.  Drinkable, but just barely with better choices available. Hard to find the good qualities in the disappointing profile.  Certainly not the WORST dark roast I have had, however.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars for one reason.  If you were using this coffee as an ingredient where you wanted the coffee and perhaps the bitterness to not be hidden too much, then this would be an excellent choice over many harsh Sumatran and French Roast coffees.

I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.

66848	B006J4MAIQ	AK7CAW3N1XZV6	Beth Cholette "doctor_beth"	5	5	5	1330646400	Almost TOO good!	I love granola, so I was thrilled to try this product.  I eat as a snack (i.e., right out of the bag) rather than a cereal.  Before I even tasted it, I checked out the nutritional profile, and I was extremely pleased.  Compared to other granolas, "Love Crunch" (love the name!) is relatively love in fat (6 grams overall, 1 gram saturated) and quite low in sugar (6 grams, just slightly over a teaspoon--most granolas are loaded with added sugar!).  The also are 2 grams of protein (a bit on the low side since this granola doesn't contain nuts), 2 grams of fiber, and 14 grams whole grains per serving.<br /><br />Of course, a serving size is only 1/4 cup, which is quite small--and that's where the problem comes in.  When I first tried the granola, I'm sure I ate WAY more than a serving; I could have easily finished off half the bag if I hadn't stopped myself!  (For reference, the bag actually contains about TEN servings.)  This granola has a GREAT taste: it is surprisingly sweet given the lack of added sugar (it's sweetened with evaporated cane juice), but it is also nicely oat-y, with a bit of a chocolate flavor as well (from the added cocoa).  The granola has little bits of dried berries--these kind of get lost in there, but what you DEFINITELY notice is the tiny little chunks of dark chocolate!  Finally, I also loved the texture of the granola, which included plenty of big clumps.<br /><br />Frankly, I can't imagine anyone who likes granola and chocolate NOT liking this product--highly recommended!

They are not the chips I have been searching for however.<br />I am still trying to find the different colored ones that fry up a bit more translucent and lighter than these. These have a heavier texture than the ones I used to get at the Chinese restaurants and are more opaque when you fry them. They are great chips in their own right and I am happy with the purchase. I would buy these again even if I ever find the Chinese restaurant-style ones. Great chips!!!!

134170	B00120U5DY	A1SRXQ9M2KO8FD	JessicaInPittsburgh	2	2	5	1322006400	Fantastic exfoliator	I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

The delicate flavour of this peppercorns makes it perfect to use it with dishes also with subtle flavour. A great product, I always have the pepper mill filled with this ones close during dinner.

Hallan "Shamrock"	2	2	5	1342742400	A great food for our dogs	I have been feeding Fromm Four Star Beef Frittata for the last month to my bichons and chihuahua.<br />The ingredients are healthful, no byproducts, grains or artificial anything. It's a family run company with its own production mill and has never had a recall, which is reassuring in today's day and age with all the recalls and sick pets!<br /><br />The kibble size is quite small, which is great for my 4 pound Chihuahua.  The other dogs don't seem to mind the kibble size at all.<br /><br />Coats are looking beautiful. I have one super sensitive bichon whose skin has stayed in good shape on this food, thankfully.  She gets yeast infections on her skin (ears, toes, face/muzzle) that can make her quite miserable.  Fromm has kept her in great shape!<br /><br />Back yard clean-up is good.  Initially when I switched the girls to Fromm, they had a little gas but once acclimated have not been gassy at all.<br /><br />Great food!  Transitioning/rotating to the Game Bird recipe now and will report on that too!

I wasn't sure if I would like them, so only purchased a few bowls.  Big mistake!  I fell in love with them.  However, when I went back, they didn't have any more!  They did have the vegetable bowls, so bought some of them.  They are also tasty, but not as good as the mushroom.  I would love to buy more, but can't afford the asking price at Amazon.  If you can afford these, try them. They're great!

291129	B002WWNLSM	A281NPSIMI1C2R	Rebecca of Amazon "The Rebecca Review"	0	0	3	1317600000	Relaxing but Weaker than most Tazo Teas	I've tried most of Tazo's teas and this is by far the weakest tea. I have to use at least two teabags per cup in order to get enough flavor. I may even try four teabags at some point although then I think the floral elements would be too strong. The ingredients include: Lemon balm, rose petals, honeybush, orange peel, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, licorice root, lavender, valerian root, natural flavors, ginger, orange oil and geranium oil. The taste of honeybush and rose come through the strongest. If you kissed someone after drinking this tea they would say you tasted like delicate flowers. Despite this not being as strong as I prefer, it is relaxing. I think I much prefer Tazo Calm to this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.

I bought it at A&P and ground the whole beans there.  Nothing tasted as good.<br /><br />But either my tastes have changed or the coffee is just not as good because this coffee had no depth.  I made it with less water than the smallest Keurig option to give it a fair chance.  I smelled it before I drank it and got no strong whiff of fresh brewed coffee.  I drank it black with no rush of memory of the original brew from forty years ago. I added a squirt of cream and it only got blander.  I drank it with a Spanish omelet (thus the iHop connection) and it served only to wash the food down.<br /><br />Now that I've finished this cup, I'll give the rest of the box to my brother and brew a fantastic cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K">Barista Prima Coffeehouse, Italian Roast, 24- Count K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers</a>.

32034	B0062A87HA	A1UN5Q1FKH1ZT7	BJ	1	1	5	1326240000	Great price!	I love to make pumpkin muffins and bread. I first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store. Although I like to use natural/organic products, pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic (due to the thick rind). However, the price of this is impossible to pass up - with S&S, the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic! I didn't think there was much of a difference in taste, until recently I made my muffins with another "name brand" pumpkin-my muffins were just OK, certainly not as yummy as usual. The pumpkin was the only difference. So here I am ordering more! Unless the price shoots up dramatically, I won't use anything else.<br /><br />I didn't realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue. If I remember correctly, I do think some of my cans in my first order were dented, but not badly enough to make them unusable (obviously - we've eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects LOL!)<br /><br />UPDATE: This latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box - no dents or dings anywhere!

Wisconsinmade's sausages have their own great flavor and firmness/texture and I really like them.  These folks even emailed me after I sent them feedback expressing my disappointment in the shipping costs for their product, and sent me an unsolicited partial refund for my troubles!  That's great customer service backing up their yummy snacks.

Poza	0	0	4	1335225600	Like a wafer cookie with creamier filling	I wasn't sure what to expect with these, but they are like a sugar wafer with a light, creamy peanut butter filling. I was pleased with the fact that they aren't as sweet as many cookies are and the filling is pleasantly fatty on the tongue. They aren't really reminiscent of Nutter Butter cookies, except that they do have a peanut butter filling, but are delicious nonetheless. The only small point about them which I don't like is that it is difficult to break the cookies apart. They tend to tear off in ragged and uneven blocks. This is a trivial matter, but makes portion control a little more troublesome and creates more crumbs in the bag.
482028	B0018KLPFK	AX830UUPE489R	Lynne	1	1	5	1346544000	Pecan Pie, 3 Ingredients, How DO they do it?!	WOW! I recently tried Lara Bar for the first time, and have tried several flavors now. Who knew an energy/meal bar could be this good? Simply amazing!<br /><br />My favorite is the PECAN PIE FLAVOR. It satisfies my craving for an actual pecan pie, and it only has 3 ingredients! The ingredients are: dates, pecans, almonds. That's it! I cannot figure out how they make it taste like pie with only these ingredients but they do. How wonderful to have an item with such a short healthy ingredient list.<br /><br />My second favorite so far is the Lemon Bar, it's really good too, and has only 5 ingredients. Key Lime Pie is good... heck, they're all good!<br /><br />So refreshing to eat something that tastes so decadent, and is made from whole foods, thanks Lara Bar! :-)

I WAS a major fan and promoter of Good Earth Tea to my family and friends, drinking it once or twice daily. But, since Good Earth changed their product "wrapper", I can hardly stand the stuff. It has a bland and artificial flavor now, even though the package indicates all natural ingredients. Think twice before buying this! I would go back to drinking Good Earth in a second if they would return to the previous recipe, because I loved it!

I think because it is easy<br />to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little<br />square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever<br />I open a can of this, she comes running!  She's meowing<br />at me repeatedly if she sees the can in my hand, and I<br />imagine that she is saying "Hey, hurry up and open that<br />can! I know what you got there.  You can't fool me.<br />Gimme that yummy food!"  But of course, she's saying<br />that in cat language.  Because I love her, I can totally<br />understand what she's saying.  What cat lover doesn't?<br />We definitely have that connection with our cats, don't<br />we?  To her, Tender Slices is the ultimate gourmet meal.

497045	B004E4EBMG	A24P1CHJN331OL	D. Davidson	0	0	4	1327536000	Nice tasting water enhancer	I don't like the taste of most water and generally have to add something in order to get much down unless it is bottled.  This has a nice pleasant fruity taste although it might be a little sweet for some people.  An advantage to this product is that it is in a bottle and you add drops so you can vary the intensity of the taste to your preference.  The liquid disperses quickly throughout the water.  However, it concerns me that the lid could become loose and leak in my purse or pocket if I carry it with me (this hasn't happened yet.)  The packaging is small and would be easy to carry with you.  Of course, you can add it to other beverages for flavor as well, not just water.  My main complaint with this item is all the artificial ingredients, but then that's true for just about any product we try now days, especially if it is diet.

When I re-checked again, the price was $7.25 a box.  I got 3 boxes for $19 on Amazon (including shipping) and within 2 days so I think that's an okay deal!  I love these after a workout or before going to the movies.  It curbs my appetite for up to 3 hours so I don't crave food during the movie or raid my freezer after a strenuous workout.  I also like the pink lemonade protein powder but I haven't been able to find that on line.

The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

10641	B001BKNB04	A1QXEHVHJJQCNP	J. Lee	0	0	3	1314662400	Cat didn't like flavor	Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it. I bought 2 cases of this 3oz and they only touch it after realizing that I will not give them more food.<br /><br />It may be because I gave them Turkey & Seafood for a while in between. It's odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried). This may be a contributing factor to their distaste for this particular combination.<br /><br />Great product, just verify kitty flavor approval.

Metelnick "always looking"	7	8	5	1154044800	Rich and Satisfying Bars without Fake Sweeteners	I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw the Larabars in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours to try. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />If you are a big chocolate lover, I would just warn you that these don't taste like a chocolate bar - the combination of cocoa and chili powder is really more like a Mole sauce you get in Mexican cooking - rich, but not at all sweet. And the chili powder is not enough to be hot or spicy.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

Then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake, amped-up "Orange" soda, but what I was tasting was real, natural juice. Yes, I knew that from the label, but that's not the same as experiencing it.<br /><br />The taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine, not too sweet, and the carbonation adds a nice touch. A bit like a non-alcoholic Mimosa cocktail.<br /><br />My only reservation is that the calorie count is (perhaps unavoidably) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis - though let me be quick to point out that this is a "no sugar added" product. For those who aren't counting calories, a nice refreshing "Switch" from soft drinks!

I visited several sites looking for something unique for my new "grandkitty".  I wanted something different from the run of the mill stockings--not red or green.  This was the perfect find.  The embroidery mice really give it a unique flavor and the price was right.  I couldn't have found anything that I liked better for the price I paid.  Thanks, Amazon!

Before giving these treats to my cat Felix, I wanted to make sure to include a vet's opinion of this product in my review. So, I scheduled an appointment and took Felix and the treats in. Upon inspection of the bag, my vet (Sally Foote) looked closely at the dietary information.<br /><br />Table:<br /><br />Crude Protein:  25%<br />Crude Fat:  08%<br />Crude Fiber:  04%<br />Moisture:  10%<br />Vitamin A:  2,273 IU/lb<br />Vitamin B:  14 IU/lb<br />Zinc  75 mg/kg<br />Taurin:  0.1%<br /><br />While the vet said that the Crude Fat content was a tad higher than she would like to see, the fact that it only had 1.1 calories per treat is very favorable in her opinion.The dental cleaning is a plus and my vet did compliment the product on having that but she also stated that if you are trying to do away with daily brushing, your kitty would have to eat alot of these treats.<br /><br />Now came the real test: Felix himself. When I placed one small treat in my hand and presented it to him, he was hesitant. Sniffing it, he wasn't sure if he should try it or not. At first glance, I would say he hated it but decided to try again when he wasn't distracted by anything. So, after his nap, I presented the treat to him again and this time, he eagerly cleaned it up and wanted more. I ended up feeding him 5 treats and he still wanted more.<br /><br />This morning I found the package that WAS on top of my refridgerator, ripped up and emptied on the floor. I assume he loves them! I'm gonna have to buy more.

I did however find cinnamon apple spice so I thought I would give it a try. Wow!<br />I love the spicy flavor with a hint of apple.  It gives a warm comforting feeling.  It's great for cold winter evening and mornings. the only thing that I have a problum with is that it does bother my digestive system if I dringk very much of it very often. but thats OK because now I can buy the Gingerbread spice tea on Amazon and still have this one once in a while.

If you're looking for an assortment of all the different things you can have in a keurig you're going to be disappointed. There were two ciders, two hot cocoas and one tea. The rest were coffees, both flavored and not. I liked the ability to try all sorts of coffee and was suprised at what I ended up liking best. Now I can go out and spend money on one brand, knowing what I liked best. On the con side, there were only 34 k-cups and two of them were stale, so when you put them in barely anything came out and then it clogged the keuirg. But overall it was a good buy. It did come in a brown paper bag, but that didnt bother me either.

Who doesn't like cereal, really?<br />It's definitely chocolatey! I would not imagine I'd like to eat this first thing in the morning, but it would be a good little snack, or lunch even. There aren't many berries, and the pieces are very little, but the flavor is there. There was just the right number/size of chocolate pieces. The bag is also a little small, but then granola bags tend to be as they are very dense. It's very rich, and I was not tempted to go back for a second bowl (in a row).<br />It is all organic and non-GMO, which is really nice. It doesn't have that much fat (for granola-notoriously unhealthy), and has 2g fiber and protein each. Only 6 gm sugar, which seems very low to me (luckily!)It's got a lot of whole grains and omega-3s too, which is supposed to be good for me.<br />Overall this was a fine cereal, I will definitely save it for a snacktime treat again.

Ive been trying a few different brands and blends of k-cups recently and this one is by far my least favorite. To compare, i have just finished a caribou blend box, a newmans organic dark roast box, etc. I tend to like a medium strength coffee and i find the darker roasts work better for me-i tried the tullys black with sugar, and immediatly got this burnt cigarette aftertaste- long time coffee drinkers know this taste-ugh. I havent gotten this aftertaste with the other brands. I tried the tullys again, with milk and sugar, which is my usual preparation-i thought this might mask that flavor, but i can still taste it. I am dissatisfied with this brand, and i wont buy it again, too much wasted money with the boxes being 10 bucks each.

431632	B0009X0RA6	A1ZR5Y78S7U8X1	M. May	3	3	5	1297641600	LOVE this dogfood !!	We switched our 5 dogs (mini-doxy, 2 border collie mixes, lab, & shih tzu) to this food from Pedigree last spring. We had been having trouble with loose stools on the lab and shih tzu & itchy bodies on the border collies . We had been mixing wet Pedigree w/dry. I noticed a slight color change in the dry bag one day and a consistency change in the canned and shortly after we had very soft stool problems with my 2 small dogs. After researching online, I was shocked about the research findings of all these dry foods. For many years we fed Science Diet but changed to Pedigree for cost reasons and because it seemed to be such a popular food, readily available and ran all those tender commercials on tv !! It made me sad to think we've fed poor quality food to our pets all this time. Like the other reviews, I agree the quality and price are fantastic. You can find better food for many more dollars but if you're feeding several like we are then this is a food you will be secure feeding. Some of our dogs are old and some used to be picky eaters but they clean the bowls quickly and have shiny coats, no itching, solid stool & lots of energy. You won't go wrong choosing this food for your four-footed furry friends !

(250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

Several are show cats and I breed the occassional litter. I have been feeding BB Wilderness Duck and/or Chicken for the past couple years as 80 percent of my cats diet. They all love it and their coats are great. I have one cat allergic to fish so do not use the salmon diet, but he seems able to tolerate the small amount of fish that is in these other two formulas. My only complaint is that it is only available in small bags. I would prefer to be able to buy a 30-40 pound bag rather than a bunch of 11 pound bags.

I'll never go back to regular oatmeal again! I cook mine overnight in the slow cooker using a variation of Alton Brown's Overnight Oatmeal recipe, substituting raisins for the figs just because I like them better. My slow cooker tends to run hot so I put the temperature to "warm" overnight and then crank it up to "low" about an hour before serving (just enough time to have coffee and read the morning paper!).  My family devoured it and asked for more! Pretty good for folks who don't normally even eat breakfast!<br /><br />[...].

This one worked for me from the beginning, but other products weren't so great at first. Now that I'm more used to them, I enjoy the things I once disliked.

I am so amazed that this is a frozen meal and I am so pleased that Tandoor Chef is so affordable. Also, Tandoor Chef does not give me any stomach problems, yet most other frozen food makers of all types do. I am blown away how good this stuff tastes, how much it fills me up, and how affordable (and easy!) it is! The chicken is very tender, very juicy and it tastes like someone just spent hours in my kitchen! There is plenty of sauce included in this meal, which is excellent for my rice, etc. Amazon delivery in dry ice and packaging was perfect. I make some rice, veggies and other stuff I like and pour this meal over it; I can eat this every single day. Thank you, Tandoor Chef - for your amazing meals!

This is blasphemy!<br /><br />Ranch is an awesome flavor, and these CornNuts are highly addicting. BBQ is also good, but honestly I think ranch are the best.

251694	B004MULTZO	A3SNANLPSCLJ70	Donna "Beezer"	1	1	5	1346371200	The best quality grain-free dog food available!	I have been feeding my Puggle and Pug Fromm grain-free dog food for three months and it has really improved their coats.  Shedding has dramatically decreased to that of a 'normal' dog. (Pugs are notorious shedders.)  Their coats are now so shiny and soft!  I don't get a big cloud of dog hair from petting them anymore.  I haven't had to use the Furminator in . . . 6 weeks, and I may not need it anymore at all.  Their coats are beautifull and glossy and hardly shed now.  Before Fromm, there was always a ton of hair on my dark leather sofa and I just realized that there is hardly a hair on it now!  Wow!<br />My dogs LOVE Fromm and gobble it down.  We only feed our dogs Fromm dry food and use it for training treats -- they love it that much. (Okay, we also give our dogs natural chews like Bully Sticks, Pizzle Sticks, and dried cow esophagus, but they are all natural, too.  No grains, no sugar, no coloring.)<br />I like that it has a natural ingredient in it that reduces feces odor --- and it REALLY works!  If they get an 'outside' treat (all we feed them is Fromm, and use it for treats) I can always tell by the horrible (regular/bad) smell of their feces the next day.  When they don't get any unathorized treats, the smell is greatly reduced.<br />Also, Fromm doesn't have any fillers, it's a 'rich' dog food, in that you probably won't need to feed your dog the same amount that you were feeding them if you were using a dog food filled with corn and other fillers.  The good thing about that is that you get LESS poop.  (And that's always a good thing!)  My dogs generally poop 2-3 times a day and it is well formed and not overly malodorous.<br />Go slow in transitioning your dog over from regular (corny) dry food, because Fromm is a very rich diet.  Check the back of the bag for how much you should feed your dog and also calculate in treats or you will wind up with weight gain.<br />Fromm has never had a dog food recall.  That's awesome!  They are very careful about their ingredients.<br />I truly believe that spending my money wisely on such a high quality, grain-free dog food like Fromm Beef Frittata will provide my dogs with a long healthy life and that they will be less likely to have diseases or cancer.  I can already see a great difference in their coats.<br />I don't feed my family 'Frankenfoods' like corn syrup, sugar, 'flavorings', by-products and grains, and I wouldn't feed my dogs any of that either.  I believe I'm making an investmentin my dog's health by feeding them Fromm brand. Four paws up for Fromm!

Seller contacted me via email shortly after I ordered to thank me for my order, included detailed instructions, and included a free super green plant food. Shipping was a little high, but super fast and the quality made up for the higher shipping cost. I have been looking at my local big box stores and all of the bamboo was rotten and yellow. Would order again without hesitation. Thanks again!

I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

Putnam	1	1	5	1273017600	Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there	I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

Vine is such a great innovation to get one to try or discover things they otherwise would most likely never become acquainted with.<br /><br />This is very good coffee, but the fact that it is one of the packet varieties leaves the necessity to have one of the brewers designed for such in order to obtain the correct results. I found a really inexpensive Mr. Coffee here for under $20 that I can "always" use to keep on hand in my seldom used cupboard above my fridge so it is available but out of the way. In lieu of this solution, I would suggest perhaps a french press setup that one could really squeeze the packet in order to get the full benefit of the ingredient....which, by the way, is an excellent Ethiopian yirgacheffe, totally organic (yeah), and of medium strength....just right (for me at least) on those yellow-sunshiny-mornings that seem to be quite frequent here in my area of the country of late. Back deck, wonderful spring sunshine, a croissant and a cup of this yummy brew is perfect for starting a beautiful April Day!<br /><br />Many have complained here about the strength, etc., but they are not processing the packets properly, thus I would recommend discounting most of those reviews. This really is great coffee....you are hearing this from a lifelong coffee-hound who appreciates almost all blends and harvests of beans from the world over. Trust me, Ethiopian is one of the Very Best Beans, along with Kenyan and Sumatran....all three of them are unbeatable for a "true" coffee-lover!<br /><br />Enjoy this exceptional coffee.......(while you're at it, give a few thoughts to it's Namesake...Bob Marley...it will further brighten your day.<br /><br />~operabruin

I used 750ml (scant 1/4 cup removed, to make room for beans) of vodka, and 12 beans split, steep for a couple months and get lots of great quality vanilla extract.<br /><br />I'll be ordering these again.

We had been feeding them Innova red meat then Evo grain free kibble and although they liked these foods, they still had the ear issues. WE went to a new vet who a  practices Chinese medicine for pets as well as his long standing traditional vet practices. He suggested the SOJOS grain free with non-heat producing meats or fish  or cooked eggs . Since we have been using these foods, our dogs have been clear of ear issues and they love the food, It is easy. Although as others have said, there have been some changes to the food, I do not believe this is a negative. I think the changes have been improvements. I also find the quality to remain high, no problems there either.

The only reason this product did not get five stars is because my box arrived frozen.<br /><br />When the cans of herring are frozen, the mustard separates into a sad mess of watery fluid and lumpy yellow mustard bits.  Stirring doesn't seem to reconstitute the sauce in a satisfactory fashion.  I've had to resort to scraping the mustard off and adding my own spices to the fish.<br /><br />Otherwise, a very nice fish.  A good, mild, flavor and a great change from tinned sardines.  These are hefty cans, about double the size of a sardine can, with enough fish in them for two people (or one very hearty eater).  Herring and sardines typically contain very little mercury while being high in essential fatty acids, which makes them good for regular eating.<br /><br />I'm saddened that I have not been able to try Bar Harbor's mustard sauce in its intended form.  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered the herring in December!

It is more like drinking colored water.  It really was so bad, that my partner tore open the cups and placed the powder in milk.  It took 2 k-cups to make one 10 ounce cup of cocoa.  It was okay then, but it's much easier to get some good ole` fashioned Hershey's chocolate and make a cup that I would just crave.  Besides, living close to Hershey, where the air constantly smells like milk chocolate, supports my local economy!

I like everything they have to offer as well since UTZ seems to have fresher, healtheir chips.  You cannot feel the oil all over your hands when you are done eating these!  Will order again later this year I am sure when we run out.

It is somewhat bold but not hot, as I would consider it. Advertised as chipotle sauce, you would think it would be quite spicy. The flavor is strong enough to hold up when I used it for sauce on the boneless skinless chicken I was cooking. Really did make a good tasty sauce!  Also put on hamburgers after they were cooked..just not very good at all.  Maybe if you mixed it in yr ground beef before cooking, it would really enhance yr burgers w/that bacony smokiness..I will try that next, enjoy!

We soon became addicted to the stuff and it quickly became an expensive habit (haha). So we decided to try to make our own. There was a recent sale on these Lipton tea bags so we decided to try and make our own. Wow, there is a lot of sugar that goes into store-bought iced tea! It was nice to control the amount of sugar that went into the tea AND this package made four times what we got from the store and at a quarter of the price! Oh, and the taste was still great :-)

After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.

Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.

One thing that I would like to have seen on the product description is a reminder that this product is perishable and has an expiration date.  This should be known to the consumer but I wasn't thinking about that when I purchased it early in December for a Christmas present.  I would have waited a few more weeks.

You just need to be sure you order enough stuff at one time to make the shipping reasonable. It starts super high, but as you add more items only goes up slowly. These are 'soy flour' so it is likely that they have hulled the soy nuts and made it less good that actual soy nuts with the partial hulls still on them, but the texture is just like a really hard dried bit of bread. They do not soak up fluids much, so you can use them in salads or added to meals without them getting soggy.<br /><br />Very good. Just make sure you order enough in your order to not get ripped off by the high shipping for small orders. Very annoying from this merchant!

This food is not as smooth as some of the others and is a mixture of 4 foods, so I didn't start feeding it to my baby until he was 6-7 months old.  He's 9 months old now and still loves it, and I think it's better now that it isn't as smooth.  I could see feeding him this for awhile longer alongside solids or as a snack.

377885	B002GJ9JY6	AHOSY8W7EWK4O	A. Parker	24	24	5	1294099200	Peanut Butter Flavor without the Peanut Butter Guilt	I love high-octane peanut butter, but not the fat/calorie content.<br /><br />TASTE: If you are accustomed to low-salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)<br />BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a "PRO" because it helps with portion control. I make it as needed.<br /><br />This product will not change your life, but it will satisfy your peanut butter cravings.

The tea has a nice mild flavor and was very fresh.  Mint tea is just gunpowder green tea and fresh mint, sweetened to taste with ample sugar, and usually served in small glasses rather than tea cups from a special tea pot, often raised high in the air to aerate the tea as it is poured.

The result is simply the best chai tea latte that I have had, except for the chai latte you would get in the Starbucks store. This is not that drink, but a similar but inferior product. Yet you will be able to buy a better at-home product. And the price here on Amazon at the time of this writing is better than any that I know of in stores.<br /><br />We go through about 2 boxes of this per week, and I am happy to be able to get it on Amazon, tax free, with free shipping.

It was delivered by FedEx. The flowers were slightly wilted from being out of water for the 12-24 hours they were in transit but they perked right up after being put in water.  Included in this package was a nice vase and 2 packets of plant food.<br /><br />Keep in mind these are mostly buds and will take a day or two to fully open so you might want to have them delivered slightly in advance like I did.<br /><br />The only possible negative I can think of is the fact I was not provided a tracking number by email to track the package, but it did arrive on time and in good condition.

Most of the assortments I looked at on Amazon had quite a few critical comments about the assortments being limited, misleading or just plain past their expiration date. Then I saw this one--I got to choose all my varieties, they came quickly, and correctly--and so far I've been enjoying experimenting. It's well worth doing so as the various coffees are very different. There are some I like, and some I don't so I'm happy to pay a bit more for these samplers--to avoid having to use up a box of a type of coffee I may not enjoy.<br /><br />One important note: make sure you send the email specifying your choices promptly after ordering. I used the communicate with merchant feature to do this. It wasn't obvious in the ordering process.

When I got her home she was so scared and nervous from the strange surroundings. She would not eat or drink and had horrible watery mucous bowel movements. After a visit to the vet that showed no  parasites we put on the bland diet. I researched organic dog food and was very impressed with the reviews of this food. No one in my area, Lancaster PA. has this product. I sent for it and weaned her off the bland diet. After only two days on this food her poops are solid small and firm. I am so thankful. She is really doing well and she is a very sweet girl and looks at me with grateful brown eyes.

If you like Stash teas, I recommend signing up for the auto delivery option which can be set for up to 6 months apart and reduces the price of the item.<br /><br />I tend to like white tea and the peach flavor is mild so I don't get that fake peach taste you find in some tea.  It's a good balance with the white tea.  I have a small 4 cup drip coffee maker and put 2 bags in the filter basket and about 2 T sugar in the carafe and end up with a few great cups of tea.

Try Woody's Smokehouse or try the venison summer sausage from the Vermont Country Store.  Heck, even Hickory Farms is better.

366657	B0027IQC6E	A1T8KV4XK2LJ	Kristen	2	2	5	1317427200	Amazing transformation for allergic golden	I've been feeding my nine year-old golden retriever Sojos for the past eight weeks (nine weeks if you include the transition period).  He's had so many positive changes that I wanted to write a review.  In the interest of fair disclosure, I have also added the following supplements to Teddy's food (starting at the same time I started Sojos): apple cider vinegar, salmon oil, a probiotic, and Dr. Pritcairn's "Healthy Powder" (nutritional yeast, lecithin granules, kelp powder, bone meal and vitamin C).  Given that the biggest change was the food, I'm giving most of the credit to Sojos, although I do believe the supplements are helping.  Here are the changes I've noticed:<br /><br />1. Minimal evidence of allergies.  Teddy has been highly allergic to pollens since he was tested at 18 months old.  I now believe he's also been allergic to some grains.  He has been on extremely expensive allergy pills and shots for years, which I've been able to discontinue with no trouble.  He has also been highly susceptible to nasty hot spots in the last few years (three occurrences in the last 8 months alone) and regularly had eye and ear infections.  He would also lick and chew his paws like crazy every day, to the point of tearing his paw pads.  I haven't seen him lick his paws for two weeks, the fur between the paw pads are no longer stained with saliva, and his ears are a nice flesh color (instead of their usual bright pink color).  I am so happy to see him comfortable, for once!<br /><br />2. Awesome weight loss.  In July he was 87 lbs (typical weight for him), but today (October 1st) he weighed 73 lbs (!!!!) when I took him to the groomer.  His highest weight was over 90 lbs.<br /><br />3. Increased energy and mobility. He has started acting more like a puppy again--zipping around the backyard like he's chasing some imaginary animal. :-  He was diagnosed with arthritis in one of his front elbows last December and has been on strong pain meds (he couldn't tolerate the NSAIDs).  I've dropped his pain meds to half the original dose and he's hopping up into our SUV with ease.<br /><br />4.  Fewer eye "goobers" and cleaner teeth.<br /><br />5.  Improved digestion and elimination.  No more rumbling stomach or stinky bombs.  Virtually no pee burn-stains on the lawn.  His poops are half the size, firm instead of runny, and have 80% less smell.  What's not to like about that?! LOL<br /><br />I love the convenience of the Sojos Complete and plan to try the beef flavor soon.  I've been very reluctant to try any variation of a raw diet for Teddy because I'm a vegetarian, so I *really* appreciate not having to prepare raw meat!  Although I initially purchased Sojos from Amazon, I have found it $18 cheaper per bag elsewhere.  It's not cheap to feed a large dog, but I am saving so much money in reduced vet visits and other medications (not to mention a happy, healthy dog), that the extra cost is well worth it!  Teddy eats his food with gusto, instead of begrudgingly.  I love my "new" happy, healthy dog!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/14/12: Teddy (who just turned 10) is now down to a healthy 61 lbs and is still doing very well.  He did have another small hot spot on his tail two months ago, but otherwise his allergies are still well under control, he has tons of energy, and we're thrilled with the weight loss.  I've used the beef flavor on occasion to mix things up, but Teddy's preference seems to be for the turkey.  I do hope Sojos will continue to come out with new varieties of the complete mixes.

Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy.

I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor.  I found it in a Food Max in Stockton, Ca but then the store closed down.  I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also.  I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it, so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from.  The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all.  This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store.  I am buying enough to share with my friends.....

401525	B000Q611U6	A316RLHHO9Y24T	myoho guy	0	0	5	1222128000	Great for Adults	I have long been a big fan of Clif bars (Chocolate Brownie flavor), so I was eager to try this product. I was pleased to see that just one of these ropes equals a full serving of fruit, and that the added sweetening comes from fruit juice.<br />Texture is pleasingly firm, although a friend who tried it wondered whether kids would like it because it the "chew" didn't last long enough. The flavor is intense mainly because of the concentrated fruit content and there is an interesting "sweet-sour" flavor probably due to the added pectin. Kids who are used to very sweet fruit treats may not like this aspect, though.<br />Here's a Pro/Con list to summarize:<br />PRO<br />-Certified USDA organic<br />-Full serving of fruit in each rope<br />-No added sugar or high-fructose corn syrup<br />-Convenient (see comment about packaging, below)<br />CON<br />-Kids may not enjoy the sweet-sour flavor<br />-Individual packaging (it's a compromise between being convenient or being green)

I am at the beginning of my gluten free journey and have largely been dismayed by the taste of most gluten free foods purchased to date. But these cookies are AWESOME!  I love the strong gingery flavor and while they feel quite hard to the touch, once you put them  in your mouth and chew, they break apart very easily and practically melt in your mouth. I wanted to eat the whole bag during the first sitting and enjoyed them so much that I nibbled on them throughout the day until the bag was empty.  YUMMY!<br /><br />I didn't order these through Amazon, I purchased them at my local supermarket.  I always worry about the age of mail-ordered food and the conditions in which they were stored.  Plus, I can see that given the hardness of these cookies, if shipped they probably would be mostly crumbs upon arrival.

You can get a gas station cappucino for less or buy a cappucino maker.  A maker would make up for itself cost-wise in a short time if you're not spending tons of money on buying the cappucino.
391195	B000P0ZC7G	A17HMM1M7T9PJ1	Timothy B. Riley	22	22	5	1282003200	A Yankee's take on a British staple	Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them "adverts"), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as "Umami". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.

But, since Amazon's free-shipping price is lower than our local Safeway's nearly five dollars per box, that's where we get it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- It tastes great, even with the non-fat milk we've been using forever.<br /><br />- Dry cereals made from wheat are much more filling than those made from corn, rice, or oats.  I have to eat twice as much to be full, if the cereal is made from those grains.<br /><br />- It stays reasonably crunchy the entire meal, and I have a big bowl every morning.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an opened box; although at the rate it's consumed around here, that's usually not very long.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an unopened box for many months.<br /><br />- Good daily dose of fiber, although that's not the reason I eat it.<br /><br />- If you are a regular Wheat Chex customer, save 15% through Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" offer; prominently displayed on the product page.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The inner bags used to be easy to open by hand, but the geniuses at General Mills now seal the plastic liner so completely, you'll need to cut it open.<br /><br />- Three decent-sized bowls of cereal is all that's in a box.  The smaller the package, the higher the cost per ounce of cereal.  I.e., if the box was 50% bigger, even though the box would cost slightly more, the cost per ounce of product should be less.  Apparently, General Mills is afraid sales would lag if a "box" of Wheat Chex cost any more.<br /><br />I've been eating this stuff for 50 years.  When I travel to a foreign country, one of the things I miss is this cereal.

The chocolate is in the shape of a  tiny and thin tea cups. There are only about 8 pieces of them, weighing less than 0.25 lbs total. I know there is very tiny fine print stating the pictures are only serving suggestions, but who the hell in the world sells chocolate with full blown misleading pictures like this?<br />Additionally, the quality control is so poor. I ordered 4 boxes of this. The first box, all of the cups were severely deformed with extreme color variation. The second box, the cups were in good shape, but the color is very grainy with white spots all over, looks like very old chocolate. I was too embarrassed to share the chocolates with anyone lol.. I can't wait for more surprises on the other two boxes..

I tried almost every milk-based formula available at the grocery stores (with no success) before trying this one.  This one gave me my happy baby back, no more constipation.  It is labeled "low" iron, which means that it is fortified with about half as much iron as the excessive amount found in other formulas.  I found that I could mix this up to about half-and-half with other formulas before the constipation set in again.  I don't understand why this formula is not available through the stores; however, I found ordering it by the case through Amazon to be really convenient, with free fast delivery, and price slightly less per ounce than most of the formulas at the grocery store.
454516	B001EO65ZK	A2MQILM9YVE6E0	Cordelia Ryan "Cordy"	2	2	5	1304985600	Yummy Tea	First began drinking this when I had a cold, and it was like I couldn't get enough of it. Very sharp taste--not exactly tart, but just this side of it. Satisfying is the word that comes to mind. I don't add sweetener or anything--think it is perfect just the way it is. I can get three cups of tea out of one tea bag, although the last cup isn't quite as dark colored. This tea delivers on a lot of levels, because it not only tastes great, but is also a beautiful, deep-vibrant red. I've read Hibiscus is very good for a person, but even if it wasn't, I would still drink it for the taste. The fact it is organic just about makes it perfect in my eyes.

I have been looking for something with just the right balance of hot and sweet, and this is it.  I've only had one other mustard that I liked more (and it's made by some German restraunt in Oregon, so not exactly easily available), but that mustard was so hot it cleared my sinuses right away (part of what I liked) yet is not as well balanced with sweet as this.  This is perfect mustard for brats, italian sausages, whatever.  I won't use it for everything (not all ingredients are suited) but I will be getting this on a regular basis.  YUMYUMYUM!

568229	B00474D08Y	A3SLNFXTZNJQ66	Tealover	0	0	5	1313366400	Delicious sweet and spicy tea	A few years ago I had this tea at a retreat and fell in love with its unique and multidimensional flavor. I was unable to find anywhere that sold this tea until recently, when I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. This is a very sweet tea - I always add sugar to tea and this one is sweet enough without any extra sugar. However, the sweetness is not overpowering as it also has a strong spice flavor. It smells amazing while brewing and tastes just as good. It makes excellent hot or iced tea, with or without milk/cream. If you are looking for something a little bit different to spice up your tea cabinet, this is the perfect choice for you!

It tastes good enough that my finicky senior cats like it and will eat it.  And my 'fat cast' like it as well, but not so much that she gorges on it.  Not only have the overweight cats lost some weight; the coats on all four of the cats are nice and silky now.  I'd recommend this food for anyone with either senior cats or ones that need to lose some weight.

One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

The aroma is not as rich as a good loose leaf tea, but this tea is very flavorful.  Quite delicious actually.<br /><br />One tea bag provided several cups of good rich tea.<br /><br />I am very happy with my order, and I would highly recommend if you are looking for an Oolong bagged tea.<br /><br />Thank You!

279568	B008MQ1AY4	A3908E1G8IL52G	Jessica Ztardust	1	2	5	1312243200	Highly Addicting!	I did not purchase this product off of Amazon. I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear "skin" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!

54247	B001H0FI22	AOVROBZ8BNTP7	S. Potter	1	1	5	1245196800	Foamy Deliciousness	My first choice in coffee is American style, black.  But it's tough to resist a sweet, creamy, rich coffee drink.  Dolce Gusto Cappuccino delivers on all those points.  No, this Cappuccino is not in a league with one made from the very best, most expensive beans, freshly ground.  But against most home machines or stove top contrivances using readily available beans, this cappuccino more than holds it's own.<br /><br />It is creamy, foamy, and mildly sweet.  Which brings up my only complaint with this drink.  I enjoy it more when I add a bit of sugar or simple syrup to the bottom of the cup, before brewing.  Then a slow stir with small spoon is enough to infuse the whole cup with sweetness.

So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now, I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don't always carry it.

Well, I was impressed. This has to be one of my favorite flavored coffees, along with some hazelnut ones, even though I typically prefer unflavored coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE 2011-01-03: I don't like this as much as I use too... it's not bad, but I'm just not "excited" about the flavor as much anymore. Plus I find it leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. I'm not "wanting" it in the morning, instead preferring to desire mostly unflavored coffees - like "Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast)", which is really good... so I'm reducing my rating to 4 out of 5 stars.

When I broke it down for Striper, she ate it all...so did the kittens who even fought over it. But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it... Probably depends upon their regular diets, but this wasn't a treat in my opinion...

253304	B004JRMG98	A1BTNPMESS99PL	Nunya Biz	0	1	4	1318118400	Delicious with a hint of spice	This is another of Taco Bell's sauces that I am enjoying. It's just a hint spicy, but full of flavor (though not necessarily bold). I use it as an alternative to mayo on my sandwiches. I recently switched over to lite mayo which I absolutely detest, but I just can't justify the calories and fat in real mayo. That's where this comes in. Each 1 tbsp is 55 calories and less than 1 gm of fat as compared to lite mayo which is 35 calories and 3.5 gm of fat per 1 tbsp. The sauce has slightly more calories, but is well worth the switch. It's delicious, adds a touch of spice to my sandwich and almost reminds of those gourmet type sauces like those added to certain sub sandwiches from a well known chain. I also like it on fajitas, tacos and other traditional Mexican food. I read in another review that it was nice on a lite salad, so I tried that also, and yes, I agree totally, it's a very nice dressing for such. So, all in all, I'm impressed with these Taco Bell sauces (including the Chipotle flavor) and would recommend you at least give it a try.

It has a fair amount of protein in it. I mix it in with other things that have a stronger flavor, like cheddar cheese soup and you really can't taste it. It does make the texture of the food a little different, a bit grainy I guess.
248207	B004J6R38I	A3FKQV7AUH481W	Amber	0	0	2	1348012800	Not the best taste for fruit snack	I purchased these fruit snacks to give them a chance at curbing my sweet tooth. These fruit snacks leave a very strong aftertaste in your mouth. I tried the Fruit Grove Nuggets which left me with an overwhelming flavor of banana. Next I tried the Orchard Sours, I love sour candy, and hoped this would taste better. This flavor left me with a strong taste of lemon rind in my mouth. Lastly I tried the Berrilicious Nuggets hoping I didn't waste all my money on these. The Berrilicious left me with the flavor of blueberry as an aftertaste. This wasn't so bad compared to the others. I will eat the Berrilicious, but not the others. I, personally, will not buy these again.

I've tried the spaghetti & meatballs (which is really darned good), the hawaiin nuggets (which I'd rather not have to try again), and the vegetarian steak...  The Vegetarian steak is definitely edible, to the point where I'd be ok with eating it again.<br /><br />The "steak" bits are quite tasty, have a good texture, and quite plentiful.  The biggest issue with the veggie steak is the texture of the vegetables: on the box, it shows all sorts of nice yummy crisp looking veggies...  whereas it turns out its really just a gelatneous goo.  It's pretty yucky looking, but it tastes decent.<br /><br />Definitely good for camping, or if you need to eat kosher on a business trip.

They are GREAT for me because I am trying to cut back on "bad" carbs due to insulin resistance and PCOS. I have been craving sweets so badly (fell off the wagon during holidays and trying to get back on again!).<br /><br />The chocolate taste IS subtle but it is noticable enough for my 4 year old to say "mmm chocolate nuts!". He's really picky and he loves these.<br /><br />I didn't find them too dry or burned tasting. They tasted great to me. I bought the 100 calorie packets and they are great to keep in my purse. The 100 calorie packs have 4g carbs and 2g fiber.<br /><br />A chocolate candy coated almond this is not. It's basically almonds dusted in dark coccoa powder -- and sucralose is listed in the ingredients. The cocoa does not get messy on my hands and that is another huge plus !

Klein	0	1	3	1235088000	no lemon. not much green tea	If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

Going to college in New Hampshire, however, has made it a bit difficult to get.  If I am willing to pay the shipping for a bottle of Topo Chico, just think about how good it must be.  It's worth it!  Other mineral waters are good, but they don't compare.  Really!  You won't regret buying it.  It is definitely the best mineral water I have ever tasted. Don't settle for less! Oh and don't forget a bit of lime and a lot of ice. :) Serving it chilled is the best.

The 3rd cat, notoriously picky, will only eat the yellowfin flavor.  He doesn't seem to like foods with whole chunks in them, but he is very fond of thinner foods with gravy.  There is less gravy in these cans than you find in "regular" store bought food, which means you get more actual food.  Good for us, but not so good for my picky cat who wants nothing but gravy!<br /><br />It's somewhat comforting to see recognizable bits of food in the cans.  The shrimp in the tuna & shrimp flavor especially is neat - they're whole salad shrimp.  Also, the food sits well with them.  The price isn't much more than what you'd pay for good food at a pet shop.  All in all I would recommend trying this.

I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.

I was always worried about them swallowing big chunks.<br /><br />And I really hate flavored plastic bones, as well as veggie bones, since I've seen chunks of those being swallowed whole right in front of me a number of times.<br /><br />These have been by far the best solution for me.  It takes the dogs much longer to chew them, and they really have to work at it.  For all my medium to heavy chewers, these are my first choice.<br /><br />Having said that, nothing is 100% safe.  After chewing up most of the bone, a very food motivated chewer could the remaining hard chunk - which could be a serious problem.  That's why I tend to choose the bigger sizes (8" or 10") over the little ones (4"), and take the bone away when it gets to a swallow-able size.  I buy these in bulk.  The value compared to other types of rawhides is huge, even without a bulk discount.<br /><br />These come in flavors also.  This plain style, as well as the the chicken flavored ones, have not been messy at all.  The beef ones are not quite as tidy.

15223	B00503DP0O	A38BE06WWL20AY	James Mcritchie "Publisher"	0	0	4	1311638400	Delicious	I love coconut macaroons and chocolate but I don't like to put on a lot of calories. These bars are a delightful snack, especially if you are trying to avoid gluten and/or dairy. The amount of sugar in a bar is low, probably in part due to the use of agave. I'm not really fond of agave and don't feel they really need it, since there is also some sugar in the chocolate chips. There is also a little too much salt for my taste but I still think this is a great quick snack for rare occasions.<br /><br /> I make my own cookies with apple sauce, using a variation of a recipe on the side of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDS6Q">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> but I leave out the sugar and salt and I add some coconut. These are even better and chewer than Pamela's but then, of course, they DO take about 20 minutes to make. If you don't want to go through that bother, Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut bar should do the trick for a quick snack.<br /><br />The Amazon listing says there are six bars in a box. However, the box is clearly labeled and says five. The box is right.

231194	B003FDC2I2	A16UNFZ22ZS9SI	Kristin Rene Lee	1	1	5	1289260800	I've tried them all...This one's a winner	I've had muscle milk, myoplex, unjury (which was tolerable), anything whole foods, central market, or the vitamin shoppe had to offer...GAG.  Then I tried Orgain.  YUM.  I am no having one of these and one Blueberry or Mango Mix 1 Protein shake per day and actually meeting my protein requirements each day.  My nails and hair are finally looking better and I'm actually starting to have more energy.  I'm so glad Amazon carries these, as my Whole Foods tends to run out of these.  I do however wish that they would put them on automatic subscription, as they have with the Mix 1 shakes.<br /><br />It's great that it's still whey protein, I've definitely never found a whey shake that tastes this good, only the soy ones, which don't have the best absorption.<br /><br />Also, it's great that you can travel with these shakes and not have to refrigerate them or mix them, as they are ready to drink.  I'll just get a cup of ice while traveling or at the office and I'm good to go!  You can even add supplement powder to it if needed, and it dissolves well in it. I actually recommend this flavor over the fudge one, and I'm a chocolate nut.  The fudge just was a little too cocoa-ey for my taste.  The vanilla is pretty sweet, which I like.  I think it might be yummy with some Starbucks Via added in it for an iced latte too.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/20/2011<br />I saw where another review stated that they had received curdled milk!  I did too.  Amazon sent 2 new cases immediately, but unfortunately both of them were curdled as well.  I had ordered the mocha from another online retailer at the same time and it arrived without incident.  I'm not sure why 4 cases arrived curdled, but it was pretty gross when I got lumpy milk instead of my usually amazing Orgain breakfast.  I wanted to do the subscribe and save, but cancelled it, until someone makes sure they know why it was curdled and can ensure it won't arrive in that condition.

On this count, chips from Food Should Taste Good easily qualify.  All the ingredients are pronounceable and identifiable (quinoa, pronounced keen-wa, is a South American grain).  I have now tried three of the seven flavors, Chocolate, Sweet Potato, and Multigrain, and they all, well, taste good as the brand name implies they should.  The Multigrain chips have a wholesome nuttiness that would go well with a variety of dips (although I'm eating them plain).<br /><br />Best of all, they're kosher, gluten-free, and vegan.  How can one go wrong?

When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my "go-to" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY">Newman's Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

For these popcorn seasonings I would recommend plain popcorn. Do not use any buttery popcorns because the butter flavor is too strong and takes away from the sweeter seasonings.

I contacted Lil' Critters customer service several times to request that they provide test results for the mercury levels in their Omega-3 supplements.  With some relatively recent news suggesting that actual levels were higher than those reported for some manufacturers, I was concerned about what amounts my kids were ingesting.<br /><br />My initial request for information was responded to with someone in their customer service organization named Hollie who essentially said the same thing their website does - that these are tested very carefully and that they are safe.  I requested that she forward the test results.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I waited a couple of weeks and asked again.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I asked again, indicating I wanted to continue purchasing these items from Costco if I was satisfied with the results and that I did not want to post my concerns in a public forum.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />Given they are marketing these items for consumption by young kids at an age where their bodies and brains are so dependent upon proper nutrition, I would think a manufacturer with faith in their products would respond to a customer request pretty promptly.<br /><br />They haven't.  So I will be switching to another manufacturer who is a little more transparent with their product information.<br /><br />Update on August 9, 2010<br /><br />For those of you who have read the post that these gummy bears only contain plant-based ingredients, please check the container for yourself.  On the one I have, it says in bold italics underneath the ingredients list that the product DOES CONTAIN FISH!  Specifically, the product contains anchovy, sardine, mackerel and tuna.<br /><br />Note that the Environmental Defense Fund has a list [...] which outlines their recommendations for the maximum number of servings of various fish species that kids should have per month.<br /><br />Mackerel and tuna are on this list and are almost unsafe at any consumption level.<br /><br />In my view, this product should not be trusted unless the company provides testing results, and as far as I can tell, they have not done that.<br /><br />Update on August 15, 2010<br /><br />I just received my first shipment of Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Gummies, and my kids love them.  No fishy taste whatsoever!  They test their products vigorously and meet more stringent European standards for contaminant levels.  Yes, they are more expensive, but having the peace of mind of a better product is worth the expense.  Check them out.

I was happy to see that it added no extra calories as I'm trying to lose weight.  The bottle is small enough to keep in my purse and has a very secure, dripless top to keep it handy and neat. The flavor was OK, but nothing to rave about.  I'd like to try other flavors in the future.

Transformed Favorite Tree with the Trivedi Blessed Water - After the San Diego Retreat -<br /><br />My story: I came home from the San Diego Trivedi Retreat and I remembered what Guruji said about wanting us to be "the happiest we could be." I had this thought in my head as I was coming out of my car and when I saw "my favorite" tree in the front lawn. I decided to convey this same message to the Japanese Red Maple tree and to the grass I walked on going to the front door as I poured the last of my Trivedi Blessed water around the base of the Japanese Red Maple and on the grass leading to the front door. Well, this year just 1 month later, the Japanese Red Maple tree has the most beautiful colored and healthy looking leaves and the most unusual beautiful arrangement of pink flowers I had not seen before. I asked my friends and family members if they ever remembered the tree producing so many pink flowers in this circle pattern ever and they all said they do not remember the tree having so many of these kind of pink flowers in this full circular pattern and so many all over the tree. Some remembered it had pink flowers here and there always, but this year they are all over the tree abundantly and each outcropping is in a beautiful and full circle pattern. The flowers are EVERYWHERE this year. ALL OVER the whole tree! Usually the flower bunches are just a few places on the tree, but after the Trivedi Blessed water; the flower bunches were so full and everywhere on the tree!!<br /><br />Also, there is a new Circle Pattern of Flowers on ONE Stem!! No one (friends, family) ever remembers seeing this beautiful circle pattern of a lot of flowers on ONE stem. Usually there are 2 to 5 flowers on a stem but here and everywhere on the tree EACH STEM had at least 500% more flowers per stem after the Trivedi Blessed water. In the past the tree never made this beautiful circle pattern of flowers per stem. Before usually there were just 2-5 flowers on a stem in a random pattern! Now there is this beautiful circle pattern of flowers we have never seen before.<br /><br />Aside from the plants, when I drink one bottle of Trivedi Blessed water daily I feel so energized and healthy. Since I have run out I see that my energy level has gone down some and I'm a little "squeaky" in my joints. I can't wait till it is in stock so I can stock up. In my opinion it is the best present you can buy yourself and any of your friends and family. I know what's going under our tree this Christmas! Maybe not the most conventional gift but my family and friends will thank me later once they start drinking it and pouring it on their plants.<br /><br />PS A neighbor asked us to watch her 2 house plants while they were gone and I used a little Trivedi blessed water that I had from my last retreat and before they could come back 3 weeks later BOTH plants are blooming!! When I asked her if she had ever seen them bloom before, she said she's had them around 5 years and had seen them bloom maybe once. Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. I only used regular water and Trivedi Blessed water on her plants while they were gone. I've seen it too many times when I've poured Trivedi Blessed water on my own plants and bushes. They bloom and flower like never before. This year I used it in our flower pots on the porch and it was the first year in over 20 years that the deer actually came up on our porch (up 2 steps to a concrete porch) to eat the flowers we had planted in the flower pot. The same type of flowers we always plant only this year I used the Trivedi Blessed water in the pots. I don't eat the flowers so I don't know but there must have been something good in those flowers this year for the deer to make their way on our porch to eat them. They never did that before and it's not like the deer around here are hungry, they are all big and fat this year so in my opinion only they were going for their dessert! LOL!<br /><br />PS For more of my results with the Trivedi Blessings and water and to see the actual photos of the Red Maple tree go to thebestoftrivediblessings.com The tree story is no. 10.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this.

My husband and I literally go through at least a box a week. We have started ordering by the case because it's hard to find in our area.<br /><br />Yes, it's sweet, but I'm a dyed in the wool Frosted Flakes fan, so it wasn't too sweet for me. If you look at many 'healthy' cereals, they have sugar too - a cup of FOCD is only 40 calories more than Special K Red Berries (my old 'healthy' cereal.).<br /><br />I think the taste is rather like Golden Grahams - not a lot of cinnamon that I could detect to make it taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch (a healthy substitute would be the new Total Cinnamon Crunch).<br /><br />5 stars!

And, when I found out it was Frank's RedHot mixed with a little butter, I was in HEAVEN!  I make hot wings at home for hubby and me (with a side of celery and homemade bleu cheese dressing!) every couple of weeks and always have a bottle of Frank's in the pantry.<br /><br />But, when I read about Frank's RedHot Sauce in Cook's Illustrated magazine about 5  years ago (I've been a subscriber since the magazine's inception) I decided that it needed to see more use than just hot wings.<br />Cook's tested it against other hot sauces, one of which was Tabasco, and Frank's came out #1 (To quote CI: "Tasters liked Frank's "bright" and "tangy" notes and potent heat when sprinkled atop a portion of steamed white rice. The full, tomatoey complexity and "luxurious" body of Frank's was also a high point for many tasters. One taster put it succinctly: "Tabasco is an ingredient, while Frank's is a condiment."") and Tabasco came in last... "Tasters said the searing heat masked any other flavor in the sauce, and most found the thin, watery body to be unappealing. "Bitter, like pepper skin," said one taster. Our recommendation is to use Tabasco for its heat, and that's all."<br /><br />The CI review opened my eyes!  I couldn't agree more and now I use Frank's in place of Tabasco with great success!  We love our food spicy, so now it's Frank's and Sriracha (which is a little more garlic-y and a little sweeter)... and maybe some Tabasco added if I want a little MORE heat!

Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

I make a cookie shake almost as good as Applebees and with a lot less sugar.  Use sugar free Murray's "oreo" cookies, sugar free cool whip and sugar free vanilla syrup along with skim milk and vanilla protein powder.  I use zero carb isopure.  It has no carbs.

I think I especially like these drinks around the holiday season.  A little sweet, a little decadent, but why not?  The Peppermint Mocha flavored International Latte by Maxwell House is a convenient and cheaper way to have a peppermint mocha at home.  Is it the same as those made by your favorite coffee shop?  No.  But it is a nice instant drink when you are in the mood for something hot and flavorful at the house.<br /><br />It mixes well, but I use a larger than 8 oz mug, so I have to put more than the recommended serving to get the taste I want.  That's another nice thing about doing it at home, you can make it as strong or weak as you like.  If you want more coffee, try mixing this peppermint mocha powder with coffee rather than water.  I like it that way too, just as I like the liquid peppermint mocha creamers being sold this time of year.  However, most of the time I just mix this powder with water.<br /><br />There is more sugar and other ingredients than coffee by reading the list on the package.  That means it is not a strong cup of coffee, which may suit some people better.  Because it is high in sugar, with a touch of fat, it is high in calories for what it is.  But it is not nearly as calorie laden as those from a coffee shop.<br /><br />So, for a nice, flavorful, quick, mix-it-at-home, powdered beverage that mixes with water, Maxwell House's Peppermint Mocha is nice to have in the cupboard for when you want a cup of peppermint mocha at home.

So when we wanted to switch our cat Caesar from Iam's and saw this on sale, I figured that I was getting quite a bargain.  Oh the folly...<br /><br />Chicken by-product meal, Corn grits and corn meal are three of the four top ingredients.  This is what the high cost buys - by-products and corn?  If we wanted to continue giving him crappy ingredients then we'd have kept buying Iams and saved the cash (not to mention the fact that Caesar actually liked it)!  I imagine the weight-loss claim is probably true, because my cat would eat just enough of this to get by...he hated it!  We decided to change to a new brand after half a bag, phasing the new food in with the Eukanuba  in growing proportions.  Throughout this short period, the kibble from the other brand was always gone first.<br /><br />If Caesar had liked it, I probably wouldn't stick with it on principle...I don't think I should pay top-dollar for substandard ingredients.  Luckily, Caesar came to that conclusion all by himself!

The chocolate is above average quality for covered pretzels, but there isn't a heavy coating, which is a minus in my book.

If they would just add a bit more chocolate coating they would get 5 stars.

Pamela's Whenever Bars are light, delicious snacks that can easily be eaten on the move. The texture is chewy, slightly dry and accented by the moistness of the chocolate chips. I found these to be best with a cup of coffee and would recommend them as a healthier alternate other snacks.

I ordered it from Amazon, not expecting much in the way of flavor.  Really, powdered peanut butter?  But a 2 tablespoon serving is only 45 calories (or 1 point in the world of WW), so I was willing to try it no matter how bad it tasted.  Well, I have gone through 4 jars (2 regular and 2 chocolate) and I just ordered the one-lb bag of chocolate.  The main thing I use it for is a Smoothie.  The middle of every afternoon I make a Smoothie with a banana, 2 TB of chocolate PB2, a half cup of fat free milk, and about 3/4 cup of ice.  Blend until smooth.  So, so good, and it is very filling and I don't get hungry again until dinner.  I also use it to make a dip for bananas and apple pieces. (Mix 2 TB with water until smooth.)  The regular flavor is good for this.  (I have used the regular flavor to make a peanut butter sandwich, but it does leave something to be desired used like that.)  I love love love this product.

Great in smoothies and for making candies.  It costs a little more than others, but the flavor makes it worth the additional cost and it is a staple in my kitchen.  For something great, mix with tahini, a little honey and a little olive oil, adjust ingredients for taste and texture - delicious!<br /><br />The LAST time I ordered, it was a totally different product, grey and tasteless and a great disappointment.  Called the company and they said that the batches vary....

Right now Amazon's price is pretty comparable to what I pay at Costco for this.  My problem with a lot of fruit snacks is you think you are getting something healthy, but the way they process it makes it not so.  This product is truly healthy!  It is organic and it is not processed with sulphur.  I think it tastes amazing!  It is sweet and juicier than any dried pineapple I've ever had.  Yes, it is not going to drip with juice because it is DRIED pineapple, but it is definitely moist and tasty.  It is a bit brown, but isn't that to be expected?  This is an organic, all natural product that is actually good for you.  If that is what matters to you, get this.  If you care more about looks and cosmetic features of your food, then I'd recommend going the sulphur route where your pineapple will look super pretty but be more unhealthy.

The wellness was a little more moist out of the package and kept my cats full with slightly smaller servings.  This may be due to the lack of filler and more protein in the blue buffalo wilderness.  I'm guessing the bag sitting in amazon's warehouse probably isn't quite as fresh as the one in a high volume pet store, thus this was just a little more dry.  Mixed with water or cod liver oil this is wonderful in treating my cat's dandruff.
384091	B002AMRNNI	AQ2ZBWWQPV26I	I Watch Movies	7	7	5	1249689600	Very tasty Mac n Cheese for health consious/ dieter	I have read about Fiber Gourmet, and specifically the Mac-mm-Cheese and I was very curious to try it out.  I mean, how good can this possibly be considering it is loaded with fiber and lower in calories.  Well, the answer to that question is pretty darn good.  In fact I just finished box number two in 3 days. The pasta has a nice al dente texture, and really tastes like pasta.  Infact, you could easily make this and not tell that picky eater that they are actually eating healthy, with all that fiber and low calories.<br />  Some people have said that they like to add cheese to this.  The first box I cooked I added a little to much milk and it made the cheese stick to the pot and not the pasta. Tonight, I did less milk,put a little smart balance, added half the cheese packet then mixed and put into two bowls. (one for me, one for the boyfriend who likes it too).  Then I split up the remainder of the cheese between the too, added a few more drops of milk, mixed, and then perfection.  No extra cheese needed because it was all on the pasta and almsot none in the pan.<br />  The price to buy direct is a little steep, because shipping is 5.99, so total cost for 6 boxes is 26.99 or 4.49 a box.  Amazon had the mac-mmm-Cheese for 6 boxes for 16.72 shipped,or 2.78 a box, so I jumped.  As soon as Amazon gets it back in stock, I am ordering.  I think I may be hooked. So if you are on the fence, just order it, you'll be glad you did.

However, this sauce doesn't have that vinegary taste.  It looks more like a BBQ sauce.  Has kind of a smokey flavor.  It also packs a punch.  Try it out with just a few drops (a VERY few drops!) until you get a feel for it.  I use it in things like soups and stews.  It REALLY perks them up!<br /><br />Soon you will be sweating up a storm and smiling from ear to ear!

Makes a wonderful second cup in the morning, or afternoon. If you're looking for something bold to hammer you over the head this isn't it, but if you're looking for something to enjoy over and over, look no further. I've also had no problems with quality control and we've gone through probably 12 boxes of this in the past 6 months.

I  must admit that I'm glad I brought these even though when you add up the weight of each bag and price you can get about six big bags at Walmart , had just reorder some more because  I like the individual bags they was fresh and not smashed up in the box. Will probably order some more later.If up to me they should have equal amount of each variety will be worth it.

Our 13 indoor cats gobbled the entire 1-oz. package in less than 10 minutes. Even our finicky eaters loved them. We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)!<br /><br />Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it.<br /><br />We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison.<br /><br />If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them. Just do a web search for "menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)". You'll be a better cat owner, that's for sure . . .

You can imagine that this gets old after awhile, so I was quite eager to try out these oat clusters (or granola, as the rest of the world calls it) to get some variety into my lunch diets.<br /><br />I'll just say right off the bat that I didn't pay much attention to how "healthy" this supposedly is because I'm primarily interested in taste, but it is indeed pretty healthy for this sort of snack.  I bet you're all wondering what this actually tastes like?  Well, for being a granola snack, it's decent.  I do wish that the cinnamon flavor was slightly stronger, and I kind of wish it was a bit sweeter.  Also, the flax flavor really comes out and it causes a sort of unpleasant aftertaste.  Overall, though, it's decent and I found it edible.  I do wish there were more clusters and less crumbly powder mess though.<br /><br />I should mention that the price is a bit on the high side.  For something that is essentially nothing but granola (and thus nothing new) you could probably buy granola much cheaper elsewhere.  I guess whether or not you want to buy this will depend mostly on your own personal preference (like the taste over other granolas, like the packaging, etc.), but I probably won't be getting any more of this item.
192809	B003P00OSK	AA71QXV60VF5X	BIS	0	0	5	1348704000	Most affordable sparkling water. Shipped free!	Super Saver shipping makes this one heck of a deal.<br />I love water, and I love Soda, who doesn't love Soda? But the problem is the sugar...  Sparkling water satisfies my thirst for bubbles/fizz in my beverage but buying it at the grocery store can be just as expensive as buying soda. Then i found this sweet deal on Amazon.<br /><br />I read some reviews from people who obviously never had "sparkling water" before...  what NOOBS!!! *facepalm*. Sparkling water HAS a "taste", some people don't like it. If you are one of those people, you were looking for WATER, not sparkling water! All sparkling/seltzer water taste the same, no matter what brand. The benefit here is that its really cheap.<br /><br />PLEASE, DO NOT confuse sparkling water with "tonic water". These are two different things. They look and feel the same, but taste much different. They are made differently too, (see: greatist.com/health/dangerfood-tonic-water-032712/). If you don't like sparkling water you will probably HATE the sour taste of Tonic water. They are easily confused because they appear to be the same, but they aren't.<br /><br />PRODUCT CONS: I noticed that the effervescence of Talking Rain faded away very quickly compared to "other waters" I consume. So if you open a can, you have to consume it quickly or else it will just be warm and flat. No good.<br /><br />That is it! I am glad I found this product!!!

The ones I got straight from the UT were badly melted and stuck together so bad that I couldnt' get them separeted. The ones that came in a box from McVites here in the States were just fine. They work well, although they give me a bit of gas. However, I do like the effect and it does help digestgion.

While we thought the rest of the pack wasn't appropriate for his age, this seemed okay since, as the name implies, is just fruit. He ate the bar in less than 2 minutes!  He loved it.  Granted, our little guy is a fruit and veggie nut so this is not a problem for us, but the convenience of a bar when we are out and about is very appealing.  So we kept the wrapper and are going to purchase a box from Amazon.  Great product even for a toddler.

I thought they had a tiny bit of an off flavor and just a bit too much salt but they are good and if you are looking for a natural snack then this would be great with dips.

I am not sure where this came from b/c other kids are not.  But this product, she doesn't seem to 'reverse eat' as we like to call it.  But the product itself is very pricey for the amount that you get (7oz vs 16 ozreg for same price).  But,all in all, the ingredients are good for my little one. We take probiotics, DHA, and eat brown rice, so why would we feed her differently?

I thought it was very weak and tasteless and chalked it up to using the 9 ounce setting on the coffee maker. We tried it again on the medium setting and I still was not impressed. I then tried the Coffee People's Donut Shop on the medium size setting and it was delicious. My husband will probably finish up our 18 ct box of Caribou (he's not as fussy), but I won't buy it again.

It is the only oil I use. We stopped using all other oils now except extra virgin olive oil for my salads. We even add a half teaspoon  to our hot tea  and it gives it a great flavor. My wife even uses it for her hair. It makes it soft and now she has no more split ends.

I've been using the flavored Coffee-Mate products for years.  I've used the store brands, but they're just ok in my opinion.  Not as rich and and not as flavorful.<br /><br />Of course the big plus for store brands is that they are usually 1/2 the price of Coffee Mate.  I work from home, and I drink alot of coffee, so when I found this bulk discount on Amazon, I jumped on it.  Best of both worlds (quality and price.

For a company who's name is "Food Should Taste Good," they certainly do a poor job of practicing what they preach. I bought a couple bags of their lime torilla chips, and wasn't the least bit impressed. Granted, I only bought them because they were so cheap, and that was only because they had been marked 75% off (after being mark 50% off, and 25% off before that). Suffice it to say, it seems that I wasn't the first person to discover their horrible taste, otherwise people would have been buying them more regularly, and the Base Exchange wouldn't have been getting so desperate to get rid of them.<br /><br />Even with a gob of Tostitos cheese dip, the taste of these chips is barely tolerable.

A lot of people will be able to tell you what restaurant makes the best penne alla vodka in their area and their opinions will vary greatly. And let me tell you, Victoria's is just about as close to the real thing as you get out of a jar. Tastes fresh and not loaded with preservatives and unnecessary additives; quick, easy and fast just serve it with your pasta of choice. This is a plus for us working stiffs. Penne, cheese tortellini and ravioli go best. Frutti Di Bosco ravioli (mushroom-shaped with ricotta, porcini, marrons glace, parmigiano & romano) is my favorite vodka sauce companion.

This is my favorite, but the Chocolate Macadamia is a close second.<br />Recently, I moved back to New York and started buying other brands of french vanilla/vanilla nut coffees as a substitute but found that many of them tasted like tepid syrup water. I'm so glad to have found this on Amazon, and plan on stocking up until I return to California because I cannot part with a good coffee.

Made with Organic Flour and Sugar, these Ginger Snaps are form the Newman's Own Organics line, run by Paul Newman's daughter, Nell. Now I have to say these cookies pack a powerful punch of flavor. If you don't like your ginger snaps to be too spicy, I would steer clear of them. They are very crunchy and tasty,but I had to have a tall glass of iced tea by my side when eating them because they really have a load of ginger in them. They are a great bite size and have real candied ginger bits in them. Even though they are a bit spicier than I generally like, I still polished off the bag quite quickly! I am looking forward to trying more from the Organic line of Newman's products.

First of all these are relatively tasteless.  Second, we found at least one bar in each pack was stale.  Third, they are not like a granola bar.  We just didn't like them.  We didn't taste chocolate or chocolate flavor.  One last thing, the box is WAY too big and is mostly empty.  The bars are quite small.  IF they can improve the taste I would reconsider but never again.  Waste of money.  If you just want to get an organic treat to munch on you might like this but don't buy it thinking its a granola bar.

If you want good, full flavored tea, don't get Lipton or most of the other run of the mill store brands.  Go for Traditional Medicinals, Good Earth or order loose leaf tea from somewhere like Adagio Teas.  You may pay a little more but you'll get real tea that tastes really good.

I found both the vanilla scent and the flavor pretty natural and I would recommend it if you like flavored coffees, especially flavored with vanilla.

I am a big fan of Happy Baby products but was really disappointed to see that this one (and perhaps others as well) had lemon juice among the ingredients. I don't understand why that is even necessary. Our son has very sensitive skin and breaks out around his mouth and chest whenever certain foods come in contact with his skin - and I bet that the lemon juice could be the culprit here.<br /><br />I just wish it wasn't so hard to find a product that had only what it says it has on the front packaging. The Amazon description didn't even say it.<br /><br />Word of warning for parents of kids with citrus allergies/sensitivities.

Khannah-Brown"	3	4	4	1281916800	Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight	****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

Forget about the adulterated, irradiated cinnamon powder that lines the shelves in the supermarket. After having done my own extensive research I discovered that organic Ceylon cinnamon is by far the best. Of all the varieties of  cinnamon Ceylon cinnamon is the one that provides health benefits. I was happy and relieved to discover Indus organic Ceylon cinnamon powder here at Amazon. It is certified organic plus the flavor is exceptional. I enjoy it with my favorite snack of 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, fruit and nuts. To that combination I add 1 1/2 teaspoons of this product. It tastes absolutely delicious! It adds a subtle sweetness without the calories, of course, and is much better for you than artificial sweeteners. Experiment to find out how much or how little cinnamon you may require on your sweet potatoes, apples, winter squash, etc. For example 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder is just the right amount to sprinkle over one sliced apple.  Also it is great in recipes in which cinnamon is an ingredient. Additionally, each packet lasts for a long time while it maintains freshness. I am a loyal customer of Indus and highly recommend the Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder.  Enjoy!

So when I saw that Red Leaf Tea carried boysenberry Matcha, I had to try it!<br /><br />And this does the berry - as well as Mrs. Knott - proud!  It tastes very authentically boysenberry... as if I might have plucked a few berries off a vine and pureed them and then stirred the puree into the Matcha - except that this is so much smoother.  The Matcha tastes rich and vegetative, with notes of butter in the background.  Deliciously creamy... this would make a great dessert substitute!<br /><br />Another exceptional Matcha from Red Leaf Tea.

21626	B002BCD2GO	A1TQIPT2QBAS6Z	Ddanimal	13	18	1	1335830400	Agave "nectar" is a scam	from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word "Agave" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as "diabetic friendly". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.

I wound up eating it every single day for 24 days in a row!  It is very creamy with tons of chunks of mushroom soup.  I also chop up some fresh mushrooms, parsely and a little garlic to "pump it up".  The soup is just fine as it is from the can, but what can I say but that I am totally addicted to mushrooms since they are very low calorie, high in fiber and are a good source of Vitamin B! The soup has quite a high ratio of little mushroom bits, but I like to add some of my own fresh mushrooms to add to the texture.<br /><br />  On a cold winter day it makes a great "comfort food" Reminds me of homemade soup - very healthy ingredients.  This is a stape in my house and I order it regularly through Amazons "Super Saver" - can't beat this deal, 15% DISCOUNT plus free shipping - why bother to go to the market when it can be delivered to your door?<br /><br />Although the directions on the can say to add milk or cream it isn't at all necessary.  The soup in the can is really creamy already.<br /><br />I like to eat this soup with some whole wheat toast.  This makes a nice little healthy snack.

I've been purchasing these bars for quite awhile either via Amazon or at one of the grocery stores I shop at.  Given their usual price, I always have to convince myself that I could find something less expensive but I know the nutritional quality won't come close to a bar like the KIND Walnut & Date.  I run and do quite a bit of cardiovascular work @ the gym, these bars are always a great calorie dense source of energy for me either the day before as a pre-workout source of energy or post-workout nutritional supplement.  I particularly like the Walnut & Date for the taste but also because it's one of the lower calorie bars the company offers.  Great choice!

184969	B004T72HRE	AKZGOBZGR1WA3	A.K.A. Me	0	0	5	1343520000	Let's set the record straight	A previous reviewer rated this tea 1 star because of problems with tags sticking to the tea bags. This can happen on occasion - obviously something went wrong during the process of assembling that batch of tea bags, but that is no reason to condemn an excellent tea, or to throw it away, Heaven forbid!<br /><br />I have been enjoying this delightful blend for more than ten years, and have never encountered a problem with a tea bag tearing due to the tag sticking. However, that does occasionally happen with tea in general, and that is why there is a wonderful little invention called the tea strainer. I heartily recommend that anyone who loves tea invest in a tea strainer that sits over a cup or mug. It will pay for itself in salvaged cups of tea many times over.<br /><br />Now, for the tea itself, I completely agree with this other reviewer that this is a lovely, subtle blend. The tea is not at all bitter as other brands of raspberry tea sometimes are. My favorite way to use this tea is to add one bag of it to a small pot of my favorite black tea (1 bag in 4 is a good ratio). It adds a lovely hint of fruity sweetness. I highly recommend it. So, if the idea of a raspberry blended black tea appeals to you, by all means indulge in this delightful tea, and maybe add a tea strainer to your order if you don't already have one.
29795	B0043GZS3Q	A2C89ZE5QWCRVB	K	1	1	4	1330473600	Good, but sweeter than I remember	I found these years ago at a small buck shop as a kid, and I don't think I've ever seen them anywhere else. I've moved since, and it's probably been about three years since I've had them last, but I remembered how much I loved them and wished I could find them again. And now I have, which is why Amazon is the best! These are packaged exactly the way I remember, same box, same wrappers. I got it in two days with Prime and the package was perfect, no nicks or tears.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I find these to be a bit sweeter than I remember. It could just be me, but I was sure I'd recognize the flavor accurately. Though that's a little disappointing, they still taste really good and smell as awesome as ever. My fiance (who had never tried them before) now loves them too.

It's not as heavy as some, is quite satisfying, and is not too sweet. It is also organic, mostly raw (which I think is healthier), and doesn't have a ton of weird non-food ingredients. It's also fairly tidy to eat - I like the kind bars also, but they are very sweet and very messy. Generally I cut it in 1/2 - as I don't think I need all the calories at once, and use it as an in-between meal snack, or to help fill me up if I've only had a smoothie or salad for a meal. I used to be a big fan of the lara bars, but I prefer these. I've bought this flavor and the coconut flavor - and buy both in bulk on on subscribe and save.
170638	B000ER3FD8	AAGBIE8SJT36V	stacysmall	0	0	1	1349654400	Contains inorganic arsenic, a known carcinogen	I had been feeding my baby this cereal for 3 months when I learned that Consumer Reports had tested this product for arsenic along with many other organic rice products and found it contains inorganic arsenic, the type that results from pesticide residue in the soil.  This shouldn't be confused with the arsenic that they will tell you "occurs naturally" if you call.  Inorganic arsenic is a know carcinogen and shouldn't be in anything labeled organic.  Earth's Best rice baby cereal had the highest arsenic content of three brands tested.  However, when I called them, I was disappointed by their lack of accountability and misleading information they provided, especially because their marketing (see above) goes on at length about the health benefits of organic, pesticide free products.  They continue to claim that the product is safe, that arsenic occurs naturally, and they don't apply pesticides.  However, they cover up the fact that the inorganic arsenic in question is not "naturally occurring," it is pesticide-derived and likely comes from pesticide residue in the soil.  I asked if they planned to do testing of their own, implement safety measures and provide refunds to customers who choose not to poison their baby, but they said no.  My opinion is that this "organic" product that is supposedly grown "without harmful pesticides" should be recalled and relabeled until they can show that it's arsenic-free.  If you are buying this by the case and feeding it frequently to your baby, you may be unintentionally poisoning them.

Servings Per Container About 6, Calories 90, Calories from Fat 10, Total Fat 1g, Saturated Fat 0g, Trans Fat 0g, Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 101mg, Total Carbs 19g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 1g, Protein 2g, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 4%, Iron 2%. Based on a 2,000 calorie diet.<br /><br />The Product Description was quite unusual, to say the least:<br /><br />"Uncle Charlie jus adds in sum of his real special dried green tabascy plants to het up this chili. Now the boys `round these parts reely lak this chili bettrn the red sissy chili. Most the womens think the green's a little hot fer thur sweet lips."<br /><br />Taste Test:<br /><br />Without all of the boring details, we followed the enclosed directions to the letter, adding ground beef to keep the initial batch as simple as possible. It smelled good as it was cooking, but we had to increase the cooking time, simmering it gently for an extra hour as it was a little flat. Let's just say that it was disappointing, and that's an understatement. For the next attempt, we tried the time tested method of cooking the chili the day before, letting it cool down, then refrigerating the batch overnight to give all the flavors time to blend. That was a very slight improvement, but not by much. Let's just say that it was reminiscent of some chili that I once had at an obscure New Jersey diner that's no longer in business. There never was a third attempt.<br /><br />Sometimes it's just better to do it yourself. This is the recipe that I use for "DIY Slow Cooked Chili" that I learned years ago when living in the South, and the one that I fall back on when in the mood for cooking:<br /><br />* 2 lb. ground beef<br />* 1 1/2 cups chopped onions<br />* 1/2 cup chopped green pepper<br />* 2 garlic cloves, finely cut (not chopped)<br />* 28 oz. can whole tomatoes<br />* 2 (16 oz.) cans kidney beans<br />* 2 tbsp. chili powder<br />* 2 tsp. salt<br />* 2 tsp. cumin<br />* 2 tsp. black pepper<br /><br />Brown the ground beef; add onions, green pepper, garlic, tomatoes, kidney bens, salt, chili powder, pepper and cumin in a slow cooker or crock pot. Cover and simmer on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Serve with cornbread and whatever hot sauce you like. Looking forward to trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JHROIM">Tabanero Hot Sauce Picante</a>, as it's been highly recommended.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />This company also makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007680BD0">Redneck Chill E SPICY</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00767OJDO">Redneck Habanerah Allives</a> (you'll just have to look at that one), but to date this reviewer has resisted the temptation to try either of these or their other offerings. However, I did receive a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7F8G">Leonard Mountain 3 Amigos Enchilada Stew</a> as a gift from a friend, and this product was easily worth a 5-star recommendation. That was one of the reasons that I tried their chili mix. Go figure.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Cannot say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7DTC">Leonard Mountain Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili</a> was the worst chili mix that I've ever had, but it's probably borderline close. What one pays for here is cute slogans and clever packaging, and this product is highly overpriced for what you get. Sad to say, even those chili seasoning packets you find in the spice section of your grocery store are better. But the burlap bag packaging was clever, and my son kept the miniature Tabasco green pepper sauce bottle, so I'll give it one star each for the creative packaging and the tiny Tabasco bottle.<br /><br />9/4/2012

Always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks. Top quality ingredients; brown rice, oat fiber, sunflower seeds etc. are what give this product the taste to start a conversation. Serve with fresh veggies and a good dip, always a crowd pleas-er!  I certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor.

I love munching on them while I am working at my computer. Yes, they are a little fishy and if you inhale while opening the bag, you might get sick, but boy, once you get past the smel... mmmmmmm. Don't buy a lot until you try them. I am about to order 20 more bags.

Quality and freshness was good but the Couscous has no flavor at all. It's bland but I can eat it since it's like mush or dry barley. I add it to soup or to lettuce with soy sauce and Parmesan cheese, good as a soup too. Also is better when cold.<br /><br />I bought Couscous at a local health nut store that has great taste by itself so I know Couscous should be flavorful at least outside of India or Iceland.<br /><br />I bought 30 boxes of the stuff so it will be not fun to eat.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I Found mold clumps (mold + Couscous) at the bottom of the inside of all my boxes.  I emailed Hodgson Mill and they tried to blame Amazon.<br /><br />They didn't stand behind their product nor seemed to care at all.  They sent me 5 .35 cent coupons for my next purchase (!).  I also had problems with Weevils (A weevil is a beetle.  Weevils are often found in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products, such as pancake mix) in their  Macaroni & Cheese Dinner Boxes.<br /><br />I won't be buying from Hodgson Mill EVER AGAIN.

12070	B0027Z8V4S	A2M98GZABSMIOR	M. jones "thejonesesgarage"	1	3	5	1337212800	Kicking decaf!	Most, if not all coffee drinkers would agree that decaf coffee just doesn't taste as good as caffeinated. Great caffeinated beans (whatever "great" means to the drinker) are pretty easy to find. But when it comes to decaf, pickin's get VERY slim.<br /><br />Kicking Horse is the best decaf for me. It's an even, very dark (consider it a french) roast and it's oily! (The whole "oily vs. not oily" is a never-ending debate.) Suffice to say, I prefer dark, oily beans and it's impossible to find oily decaf from a mass-production roaster.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have not performed a side-by-side comparison with caffeinated, but straight shots are remarkable. Few people would recognize that they were drinking decaf if they were served this coffee. (espresso or press, i can't speak to the taste of this coffee after drip)<br /><br />To qualify any opinion, it's important to understand the perspective of the reviewer. I don't evaluate coffee for qualities like "florals" or "dark chocolate" or "berries". I like rich espresso flavor, but without so much caffeine. So I cut my coffee with a dark decaf in order to get the richness that I want, and then smooth it with a little milk/cream - no sweetener, no flavorings.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I really appreciate the 15% discount for the monthly automated Amazon subscription.
434659	B00032GSHE	A2T3I3KKTOHQNF	marys	0	0	1	1338681600	Not Good	Since I like the Walden Farms salad dressings, I thought I would try this dip to eat with rice chips. However, when I tried just a little dip on a spoon, I decided not to waste a good rice chip. It had little bits of something in it that I think were supposed to resemble bacon bits. The only thing I felt they did was make the flavor of the dip linger in the mouth a little longer. While I have had worse tasting dips (like the Walden Farms French Onion Dip), I couldn't make myself eat any more than that taste. My advice to others would be to use your money to make a low cal bacon dip. Don't throw your money away like I did.

Wonderfully pristine and interesting ingredients.  1-ounce bag, which is perfect to take to work as an emergency snack if there's no time for a lunch break, has 140 calories, 3 grams of fiber, zero trans fats, 7 grams of total fat (a little high but the truth is sometimes higher fat content equals more filling) and a nice and low 2 grams of sugar and equally nice and low 80 mg of sodium.  I will save the bags and recycle with http://www.terracycle.net/ with my energy bar wrappers.  I rarely eat chips because of weight considerations.  These are definitely worth the calories.  But they could be addictive so I've gotta watch it.  Bottom line:  absolutely delicious and crunchy.

7883	B004H37C98	A1SEV72ABM2YBC	L. Bisson	2	2	5	1337731200	Best Rawhides Available Anywhere!	Sure, this rawhide is expensive at 5-6 dollars per rawhide.  However, it is excellent quality (many rolls very tightly rolled) and takes my GSD hours to go through one.  For reference, he can eat a thick bully stick in 5 minutes and a Himalayan Dog Chew in 30 minutes.  For the time spent chewing per dollar, these rawhides are a deal!  I also love that my dogs can't get big chunks off, so even though I keep an eye on them I have very little fear of choking.

Not too salty, just enough, and not the long rods that break and leave crumbs everywhere (like if you're lounging on the couch watching tv, say) - these are shorter rods, the perfect size for a proper crumbless - or near crumbless - pretzel-indulging experience.  They're fairly healthy, too, as far as snacks go.
360825	B00020HHHC	A5CR6GP49HVEE	Stephanie	2	2	2	1295740800	Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me	I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

I am normally not a bottled water fan, they all seem to taste like the plastic bottle to me. But this product had a distinctive sharp CLEAN taste, like it was extra filtered or something. It tastes better than the filtered water coming out of the dispenser in my fridge.<br /><br />I would buy this!!! DELICIOUS and refreshing!
55513	B004CYLW7A	A3KJ6JAZPH382D	Tim Brough "author and music buff"	0	0	3	1296864000	Crunchy Nuts	I mean really, how can you not resist saying Crunchy Nut? Oh wait, we're talking cereal here. Breakfast stuff. Not innuendo. On to the lovin' spoonful, then.<br /><br />Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is a sweet, corn-based cereal without any particularly notable taste. It's like eating a somewhat bland caramel corn or candy coated peanut cereal with milk. The honey is not very noticeable; the overall flavor is kind of bland. The good points are that it doesn't get soggy quickly and at 100 cal (minus milk) per serving, is pretty decent in the calorie department.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the lack of flavor here makes Crunchy Nut more like Crunchy Not. It's not particularly overwhelming and I doubt it will return to my grocery list.

543903	B006MONQMC	A25C2M3QF9G7OQ	Comdet	0	2	3	1338422400	Not bad, but not great either	Pros: It offers a decent amount of vitamins per serving and has zero calories. (Note that it does contain 40 mg of caffeine per serving so if you're sensitive to caffeine you'll want to pass on this, or make sure you don't drink it in combination with other caffeinated drinks.) One bottle lasts a long time since it makes 24 servings.<br /><br />Cons: The packaging could be better. It's hard to get it to squeeze properly - either nothing comes out, or you get a gush all at once. Although the bottle is designed to be stood cap-down, it leaks a small amount when positioned in that manner. It needs to be refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />Taste: It's just OK. It doesn't have much of a "fake sugar" aftertaste, but it also doesn't have much of a fruit taste either. It's not offensive, but it's not all that appealing either.<br /><br />I'll use up the bottle I have, but this is not something I'd pick up again.

If you just put about 25% of the sugar usually in a pumpkin pie and a graham cracker crust you have an extremely healthy and tasty dinner dish.<br /><br />Can't say much other than it is what I expected. I love pumpkin.<br /><br />As far as the reviews complaining about dented cans go... none of mine were dented, but who really cares anyway? As long as an opener will still open it, it really makes no difference.

It took my colleagues 20 minutes to convince me that I wasn't drinking urine.  It truly offended my taste buds.<br /><br />You can taste the lack of passion and pride in this blend.  Newman could take a lesson from "Our Blend" - show a little pride for your work.  Don't be afraid to think outside the box to create a coffee that doesn't taste like cow sweat. That's what makes "Our Blend" great - you can taste the uniqueness and creativity in the brew.<br /><br />My advice to Newman's Own: Step aside and let the artists behind "Our Blend" restore America's faith in coffee.

It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one.
391349	B000E65OQA	AKRVR5SJ8ONPY	Keri1386	7	7	5	1280707200	Knocks me out	I never write reviews, that's how much I love this stuff.<br /><br />I don't sleep well. Usually, it takes me at least an hour to fall asleep and get up about 4-5 times in the middle of the night for no reason. And that's a good night. On bad nights I don't fall asleep at all, or it takes me hours to fall asleep and I still get up multiple times a night. Most of the time, however, I can tell when I'm going to have a bad night so, when I saw this in the store I thought it might be able to help (plus I like the normal version).<br /><br />I drink it and 30 min later I can barely keep my eyes open. I sleep the whole night through. Gives me crazy dreams though. Not bad, just weird and vivid.<br /><br />Oh and I took this with Tylenol once because I also had a headache and I woke up in the middle of the night really dizzy. I don't know if the mixture of this tea and the pain killer had anything to do with it, but I've never experienced that before and it only happened the one time I took it with medicine.<br /><br />Other than that, it tastes good, smells amazing, and knocks me out.<br /><br />p.s. Just bought the new vanilla flavor - not as potent but delicious!

I don't like the bland taste of regular water, but I realize we need to drink as much water as possible.  Metromint tastes great and finally enabled me to enjoy drinking water.  HOWEVER, for the first time I bought Metromint from somewhere other than Whole Foods at Amazon and the seller made their own water with a mint taste and poured it into old Metromint bottles.  I couldn't believe it!  Someone actually made their own water with mint and went through the trouble of putting it into old Metromint bottles and sold them on Amazon.  Fortunately I got my money back but beware!!!

I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a "half diet" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.

Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.

I found this at our local TJ Maxx - there was this bar and a box of others that were individually wrapped for gift-giving.  I bought this bar to try it and see if I liked it.  I read the wrapper's description about marzipan and pistachio - and I was intrigued.  I have tried marzipan once before and wasn't all that impressed, but this combination is SPECTACULAR!! I was only going to have one, but one piece turned into two, two turned into three and I had to stop myself there before I devoured the entire package.  I wish they made this with dark chocolate, but the milk chocolate will suffice.  Will purchase again if given the chance - but these won't last long at TJ Maxx!

Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!

I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

My doctor recommended I try a ready-to-go formula like this one that required no additional effort on my end. When he's fussy but needs to eat, this is quick. It also smells more like breastmilk than other formulas. I packed a few in my diaper bag. We go through 1-2 of these a day. (He's drinking breast milk otherwise).

218364	B0007KLKEI	AT0T2BH84PUEE	R. P. Caudill	0	0	5	1334620800	Simple, beautiful, heartfelt bachata	As my friends will all tell you, I'm not a big bachata fan. In my opinion, a lot of modern club bachata is treacly, cloying, and overproduced. Bachata is, at its heart, country music, and it can suffer from the same problems as country music in America - once it is exposed to big money and fancy recording studios, it loses something. Joan Soriano still has that something. His songs are simple and joyful, and seem to be more closely tied to the tradition of Juan Luis Guerra, which combines the native rhythms of the Dominican Republic with a wider Afro-Carribean musical idiom (amid the bachatas and merengues, Joan even makes a brief venture into Cuban music on the seventh track,  "Popuri de Son"). There is bittersweet earnestness in Joan's music which comes through very clearly and makes him a real joy to listen to. I recommend him very highly!<br /><br />For a great sample of Joan's music, check out NPR Music's Tiny Desk Concert with him on YouTube, or for a deeper look, try Adam Taub's documentary "El Duque de la Bachata", in which Joan stars.

However, the formula has just changed. It used to have a solid consistency, and now it is very `soupy.' If you shake the can it actually sounds like you are shaking a can of soup! Not only were all of the cans I recently bought from Amazon like this, but I also went to a pet store and shook the cans there and they too were `soupy,' so it wasn't just a bad batch that I received. I think Blue Buffalo is now watering down the Flaked Salmon canned food, which is a shame. This food isn't cheap and I don't want to buy a watered down version of what they used to sell.<br /><br />I've switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WFQC">Blue Buffalo Healthy Gourmet Flaked Tuna Entree Canned Cat Food</a>.

This tastes great when it's accompanying any hot blueberry breakfast- pancakes or waffles with blueberries would be nice served with this coffee, too. It's definitely a milder coffee, but it still tastes like coffee. I drink it w/ a couple teaspoons of raw sugar & a couple teaspoons of Coffeemate, and enjoy it even served alone. Not my everyday coffee, but since I love blueberry muffins, it's one I like to keep on hand. If you like flavored coffee, coffee in general & blueberries, I think you'd enjoy this.

First off there is no preparation instructions on the package(or the Udi website) which immediately I took away points for. I defrosted (take them out of the freezer and leave them out for 2-3 hours, I put them in the fridge the night before) then I put them in the oven at 300 degrees for about 10 minutes. The texture looks like regular muffins but the sugar on the top is too much and went over to one side. The flavor is ok, but homemade ones taste better if you have a recipe you like. Overall I wasn't wowed by them and won't buy them again on the other hand the Udi Cinnamon Buns are really good.

It actually arrived early, which was nice.<br />The taste is quite bright, and is a great finisher. I just tried it with chicken, and it really made the flavor pop. I plan to try it on a chocolate mousse next.<br />An interesting by product is that since it is made in part from lava rock, it actually leaves a residue on your hands when you handle it.<br />Anyway, pretty neat and quite inexpensive. As long as you arent copiously coating all your food with it, this jar should last a while.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this salt on a variety of things, including eggs, various meats, fresh tomatoes (from my garden), as well as the aforementioned chocolate mousse (which i had been planning when i wrote the review initially) and chicken. It has continued to be a wonderful addition to my kitchen, and the tomatoes and chocolate mousse in particular stood out as bar none winners.

Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned.

I tried it a few times on different water settings on my Keurig thinking that maybe a lower setting would help. Maybe a little, but certainly not much. It was bland and had hardly any flavor. I won't be ordering this coffee again.

What's more appalling is that people eat it and not only support the misguided notion that this is something that could be considered food, but even go so far as to say that they ENJOY eating it, AND DO SO ON A REGULAR BASIS. If this product were made of meat, I would be faced with no other viable conclusion than to think that it was made from the meat products rejected by a dog-food factory. But since it is not meat of any kind, what am I to think. . . ? Is this some kind of weird joke. . . ? What IS this THING in this can? And WHAT IS THAT SMELL? And this gravy of which they spake on the label, do they mean this slime? The slime that is more gross than spam slime? SO MANY QUESTIONS. . .

Other than my one cat not eating the peas, their bowls were licked clean. It looks and smells appealing, too - such a rarity in canned pet foods. I will definitely be buying more of the Mediterranean Harvest!

423076	B003OP8M3A	A11OTLEDSW8ZXD	CGScammell	2	3	4	1290038400	Cinnamony	Opening this coffee bag didn't fill my kitchen with a strong vanilla-cinnamon aroma.  Nor did the bag emit much of a strong scent.  But once I tasted this medium roast I could tste the cinnamon.  It wasn't an overbearing taste, either, but just strong enough to be aware of the spice.  I couldn't even taste much vanilla.  So, for those of you who prefer vanilla over cinnamon, there may be other brands or flavors better for you.  For those of you who like a nicely-spiced coffee, though, this is a great blend.<br /><br />Just like the bag states, this is low acid coffee. The grounds are medium brown. I used this coffee in my cappuccino maker and created a mild espresso drink, with a bit of crema, flavored with cinnamon.  It wasn't too strong and definitely not bitter.  I like the subtle flavors of this blend very much.<br /><br />I've had other Bean Coffee flavors and like them all for their consistent roasts and flavors.  This seasonal drink is another such blend to add to Bean Coffee's quality roasts.  It's an ideal coffee for a cold winter afternoon, when one wants to sit back and savor a coffee for its flavor, rather than for its jolt.

I prefer the minis to the regular size, they are less messy and you still get the taste of the marshmallow, cookie & flavor (chocolate, banana, vanilla).  My only complaint is that I would like to be able to choose the flavors that I want in the box.  I prefer the banana & vanilla flavors over the chocolate. The box contains 2 boxes of 12 ea chocolate & one box each of vanilla & banana.  I would have liked to choose 2 each of banana & vanilla flavors.  I will probably order it again, anyway.

469209	B000AQFQC6	A8W6AQ5N6Z4MY	AK907	0	0	5	1307923200	Texture	Bottom line. The texture is kind of like eating squid. I like squid and especially its texture. Also, that "fish" smell doesn't bother me and I didn't even notice it after I rinsed it. I cooked these noodles like an Asian stir fry, I wouldn't recommend the Italian route and trying to make Alfredo or spaghetti.<br /><br />I know a lot of people who would say this was "yucky", but I'm a seafood lover who likes that elastic texture. Not for everyone, but I don't see how it is that bad either...especially with so few calories and carbs. But again, I think if you steer clear of trying to turn it into an Italian type dish and stick to more stir fry or soup, this is an excellent choice.

When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

My position is that if you want a single region coffee, and are willing to pay a bit more, you should have a roast that lets the unique quality of the bean shine, not one that buries it in the aroma of charcoal. This really could be any bean, as far as flavor goes once the coal black roast is finished. Buy a French roast or a Sumatra and save yourself a couple bucks.
489326	B000X9D8ZM	AMI795R6FD2QV	Alanna P. Ruvalcaba "anthro freak"	11	11	4	1263600000	Goji Gold	I decided to try the Goji juice on recommendation of a few people. I have tried it before, but with no regularity, so this time, I decided that I'd give this supplement a real trial. I've been taking it regularly for about a week. My basic observation is the juice does not taste, nor smell bad. It is pleasant to wake up and take my dose of Goji, versus choking down bad smelling vitamins and supplements. Score 1 for Goji!<br />Secondly, I do have more energy with the Goji supplement, however: It is no substitute for a good night's sleep. Also, sometimes it takes more than one dose to keep me going throughout the day. Granted, I've only been taking it for about a week. Lastly, I notice that if you take the supplement on the higher end of the dosage, you will not get a full 32 days out of it, which is something to keep in mind if you're watching your budget. Overall, not a bad purchase, and I will be anxious to see if the benefits from this product are cumulative. Good luck!

I decided to take the oolong tea and I was shocked that I was feeling better internally and externally, my clothes was fitting me differently. My appetite was curbed alot. I hardly was hungry. I honestly drink 4-6 cups of this tea a day and still drinking it till this day. I haven't hopped on the scale yet I am going to wait until next month to see how much weight I have lost. Since my cold is over with I will start back going to my Zumba classes this week and I am pretty sure the results will be more outstanding. And of course eating clean that is the most important factor when losing weight. So I decided to have 2 cups of oolong tea before each meal. I will have oolong tea in my diet forever. It is a must especially if you want to lose weight and don't forget the fabulous health factors also.

Enig, PH.D.<br /><br />Anyway, Frontier Vanilla Flavor is a wonderful Vanilla to us in every baking, cooking and drink you can think of.<br /><br />The next thing I have to mention is that Amazon.com and it&iexcl;¦s sellers do a wonderful job of replacing any bottles that come accidently open in shipping.  My last shipment had some problems with a the seal being broken on one of the Vanilla Bottles and I immediately notified the seller and they immediately sent me a brand new bottle to replace the bad one.  I was amazed at the service and will continued to buy from Amazon, because of their wonderful service.  So, both the Frontier Vanilla Flavor and the Customer Services that quickly replaced my bad bottle deserve 5 healthy stars each.  Which would give them 10 stars in my book. Thank you and yes, I will continue buying from Amazon, because of their wonderful quick service.  I just thought I should mention that here also.<br /><br />Oh one more thing.  Frontier Vanilla Flavor is Gluten free, and Corn free, because it&iexcl;¦s Alcohol Free, which is also a big plus in my book.  I get to enjoy my food rather than be sick.  So, thank Frontier for making such a wonderful product.  I will continue to buy this product. º

As one of many Americans trying to make healthier life choices in my food, Nana's cookies have been a wonderful treat without the guilt and bad effects of sugar, and gluten.

The ginger and lemon cookies will fool even the most sophisticated cookie palate.  Give them a try and treat yourself to a healthy dessert you can enjoy without feeding your body excess sugar, carbs, and processed chemicals.  It is all natural ingredients, with a wonderfully sinful flavor.<br /><br />Kristin, mother of 3, Arizona

The chocolate formulation has added sugar and coconut cream, so it tastes like a dairy-free version of chocolate milk. (It is slightly reminiscent of a Mounds bar.) I was hoping that this would be more like a coconut-water-with-essence-of-cocoa, but alas this is not the case. Tasty, but not anything like the other Zico products, so be aware.
380119	B002YR79ME	A3550DS8DMK5MU	MrsUhmazing	0	0	5	1344816000	Absolutely delicious!	I moved from Texas to Ohio a few weeks ago and happened to run across these at a local farmer's market. I bought one solely because I thought the packaging was cute and I love popcorn balls and this is essentially a popcorn ball shaped like an ear of corn. I've searched far and wide for good store bought popcorn balls and usually couldn't find them until around Halloween and even then they were sub par. Same goes for up here, the only place I could find these was at a farmer's market where they were selling them for $3 a pop! So until now I was stuck making my own which is really a pain. As soon as I sunk my teeth into one of these I was in love. The popcorn is rich, buttery, and delicious, they are oozing with caramel which is exactly how I like it but surprisingly they aren't overly sweet. Everything about these is just right, the crunch, the sweetness, the softness, the butteriness, everything is just perfect. I raved to my husband about how awesome they were but how I couldn't find them anywhere besides that one place but they still were over priced and he surprised me by buying me this 18pk. I'm going to have to pace myself and not eat them all in one day which I could certainly see myself doing with how delicious they are. Now I must add that this stuff is soft and very caramely so if you are looking for the crunchy caramel corn that comes in the holiday tins, this is not what you want to buy.

No cooling period necessary, and no melted ice cubes to immediately dilute your tea when you need to serve it right away. I grew up on the powdered stuff they call instant tea which really has very little resemblance to the taste of real tea, and it's full of chemicals. I prefer real tea, and the choice of whether to sweeten it or not. Thanks Lipton.<br /><br />The only tip I will offer is to compress the bags well when time is up to get all the tea from the bags, otherwise, it may end up being too weak for you.

The KCup actually makes a good full cup of coffee.  it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good.  I still prefer the Senseo Pods to the KCups though.

It doesn't taste like butter and you need to add salt. The only thing it has going for it is that it is gluten free.<br /><br />The subscribe and save price is good. Better than you can get at the store by quite a bit. I bought my single bottle at the big box store for about 2.78 so if you can get it for less with S&S then it is a good deal price wise.<br /><br />Be sure you buy a single one at the store before you invest in a 6 pack.

Well, it comes out easy.  I have room for plenty of choices in the drawer as my family likes hot chocolate and tea.  Personally I like coffee. The best thing is that it is a space saver.  I put the Kcup machine on it and I have plemnty of room for condiments.  With other storage syatems you place it next to the Kcup machine.  This takes a lot of spce.  Space is important in my cottage which is now my home.  I think this was a great buy for me.  It is funny how sometimes you buy something and it turns out to be a dud.  This is definitely worth the money.
377783	B002GJ9JY6	A3LCW5H7XK5B22	Down to Earth Reader	1	1	5	1341014400	How about this idea?	How about this idea? Even though we buy the non-hydrogenated "natural" peanut butter (Skippy, mainly)  sometimes it is still separated so there is oil on the top. Even though you can mix that oil back into the peanut butter, when you do the results are usually a fairly runny peanut butter unless you refrigerate it. Or, you could drain the oil off, but that's such a waste. So, we like to mix in some of this powdered peanut butter to thicken those runny non-hydrogenated peanut butters up! The flavor is never diluted, it is rich and delicious!

I like the tiny size of the treat because believe me, treats pile on the weight! I got Salmon ones because I figured that the Salmon oil in the treats may be good for his skin and coat but seriously, they are stinky. I keep them with all his other treats and if I've forgotten to seal the bag, the whole cabinet starts smelling! They do harden up if you've left the bag open. My dog is a typical lab and very very food motivated. I try and keep mixing his treats to keep him motivated and these are definitely treats he'll do anything for!

359454	B007M832YY	A3N4CUW4UYC9I3	MH	0	0	4	1328486400	Great flavor	For those who have never tried Popchips before, they are not exactly a normal potato chip.  Popchips are air popped rather than fried.  They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just "different" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.

I like the fact that each tea bag is individually foil wrapped for freshness. I enjoy this tea at least twice per day, especially mid-afternoon at work when time seems to stand still. If you like herbal spices you will definitely enjoy this tea.
465365	B0057IWQV6	A3V1A3C9DTLPME	Peter Faden	0	0	3	1332633600	Peculiar	I cant really decide if i like this salt or not, which is why i give it 3 stars. The sulphuric salt definitely carries that egglike scent and flavor as the other reviews have pointed out. It definitely sounded interesting, which is why i bought this, and at around $7, i am pretty much always willing to take a chance on something unproven. I have tried it by itself, an some veggies, and mixed into almond milk quesadillas, and i cant say i hated it, but as i said before, i cant really decide if i liked it either. I think this one is very much a question of personal taste. I am vegan, and dont really miss eggs, so maybe that is part of it. Dont know. I do know that it is interesting, and i certainly wouldn't dissuade anybody from trying it. You might find it to be a five star product like the previous two reviewers did...and they arent wrong. As i say, this one in particular is a subjective thing. I dont know that there is a wrong rating for this salt. Some will love it, some will hate it, and some will be undecided like i am.

They are not horrible but they are nothing like they were. They just don't taste as peanut buttery anymore; more cardboardish than they used to. They are also much smaller. I am operating under the assumption that there used to be a lot more calories in that thing than 140 because it's much worse and smaller now for the same amount of calories. This is very disappointing because that bar used to be my favorite. I was so excited when it came back that I ordered 8 boxes. Disappointment!!

Out of several fine chocolate makers- Godiva, Lindt, and Scharfen-Berger- Green & Black's has probably got the finest overall taste.

With just a little of saffron in the Paella, it make my Paella very flavorful and coated with beautiful golden yellow color. The taste was superior, I can taste saffron even with very little saffron in it. Combine this spice with other spices I brought from McCormick for paella, and they all are great!

I wanted to try cornbread since it's an item I love. This cornbread is great. I prefer a more cake-like cornbread that isn't gritty and this one works for me very well.<br /><br />I didn't have the suggested "grey 9x9 pan" mentioned on the baking instructions and since I wasn't sure how important the pan was, I skipped my glass one and used two grey loaf pans. I just divided the batter and baked for about 30 minutes. It turned out nice and fluffy, moist and delicious. I like it with a smear of lowfat margarine, a drizzle of honey and a dash of cinnamon. It's like dessert. I've eaten it for breakfast and for snacking.<br /><br />It's a recipe that anybody can enjoy, even if one isn't on a restricted diet. Thanks, Bob's Red Mill.

I selected this kit due to the fact that it seemed very easy and for my first batch, that is what I wanted. Other than adding 3oz of raspberry extract just before bottling, I used the Wheat Beer Hopped Malt Concentrate and Coopers Light Malt Extract. I do question the yeast packet as to it's freshness, but it did do it's job. One week in the primay frementer, two weeks in the secondary, and three weeks priming in the bottle. While in the seconday, the fermentation did seem to stall a bit, which is why I questioned the freshness of the yeast, but slightly shaking up the yeast kept it going and it ended with a FG at 1010. The color came out a little darker than expected compared to commercial Wheats that I have had in the past, but not an issue. So in the end, I was very impressed with the outcome and several friends that have tried it were impressed as well. I would recommend this product and will try an other batch in the future. If you are a fan of traditional Wit beer I would recommend just using the Hopped Malt Concentrate and the Light Malt Extract and let the yeast do its job. It does take a bit longer, 6 weeks minimum, but it is well worth the wait.

I also love that it's almost caffeine free, because I'm sensitive to some chocolates and caffeine.

It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.
441672	B001HTIPAU	ABAPF3XY1W6JX	TucsonShopper	1	1	4	1315612800	Very good water but not the best	The best water for tea is not heavily mineralized, orderless, and crisp. Crisp (vs flat) means to have disolved oxygen - which is more likely if cold and not repeated reboiled. Tap water is not acceptable due to typically being chlorinated and deoxygenated (filtering will likely not help). Some people prefer the taste of highly mineralized water (such as Tucson's tap water). And so, the two best selling brands (Pepsi Aquafina and Coca-Cola Dasani) are just straight from the tap. Coca-Cola even adds salts to help create that perfect tap flavor. But, salts can produce negative interactions with tea. Water for tea should ideally be pH neutral (7). My son feels a neutral pH is most important - but I normally drink tea with lemon juice ... and so a high pH might actually be better for the low pH of lemons. Did a blind test taste with friends and found the one water everyone liked least (always below Tucson's hard tap water) was Costco's Kirkland brand while the most popular was Fiji.<br /><br />Well recognized waters that tea experts around the globe agree are ideally suited for making exceptional tea include (in order of my preference):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T7YQFK">Highland Spring Non Carbonated Spring Water, 50.7-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United Kingdom)<br />Best deal at half the price of others (pH 7.8)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 50-Ounce bottle (Pack of 12)</a> (Fuji) Best tasting (pH 7.5)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIPAU">Crystal Geyser Spring Sport, 33.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United States pH 7.9)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A38Y">Volvic Natural Spring Water, 500ml- Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> (France pH 7.0)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANW7HQ">Nutriteam Countertop Water Distiller Stainless, Glass Collection</a><br />Don't use water immediately to allow for disolving of oxygen

Finally, an enjoyable, delicious, flavored coffee!  I have been very disappointed by flavored coffee made for Keurig machines.  Overall, many other flavored coffees have forgotten the flavor, with many tasting not only bitter, but day-old too!  Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut Coffee is enjoyable, a real flavor winner.

I kept her on that for only about 2 more weeks after before she was starting to refuse to eat the food and would go for my other cat's food that wasn't science diet. So I switched her to that and she ate that for awhile before getting fussy again and not wanting to eat that either. After trying out a few other foods I saw this food at our local animal store and decided to try it out. That was about a year ago now and so far I haven't had a single problem with this food. Both my cats love it and seem to like this food a lot better than the canned food even. The Royal Canin food overall might be a bit more pricey than others, but I'd say it is worth it if you have a picky cat like me.

The problem is, I eat them all within a week so I think I need a second delivery for two weeks later. :) The cookies are crumbly and taste a bit like Mexican Wedding cookies. One thing though, the cookies can come crumbled a bit at times from shipping and the size and amount of chocolate chunks vary greatly from one cookie to the next. I found that is okay though, because they are so tasty. I like dipping them in organic rice milk.

Even when I mix a small amount of Evolve in with other kibble that he eats, my cat is able to separate the Evolve from the other kibble and leave it in the bowl when most of the other cat food has been eaten. Evolve does come in a nice bag featuring a resealable strip, that many kibble cat food bags lack.

Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

This picture shows 35 different varieties, but I only received a few different flavors.  Also, these were shipped in a brown paper bag which caused many of the cups to be damaged.  I am very very disappointed with this order.  I will never purchase anything from Deals on Call LLC through Amazon.  It's a shame Amazon doesn't monitor its vendors more closely.

378960	B005ZBZLPI	A1OCJ941ACJEBO	A. Jones	1	1	4	1349654400	Good Stuff	I drink a LOT of coffee. Mostly half caf, mixing Caffeinated with Decaffeinated. This is easy to do with the single serve coffee makers. I prefer to use the same brand and flavor of Caf and Decaf. There are not a lot of brands which offer both Caf and Decaf. Then it's hard to find a flavor I like even when it is available in both Caf and Decaf. I like the taste of San Francisco Bay French Roast and it comes in both Caf and Decaf. I like their Fog Chaser flavor a lot too but it doesn't come in Decaf.<br />The coffee is held in a little mesh bag not a plastic cup. They claim this packaging is more eco-friendly. Don't know about that and I think the coffee might not stay fresh if the little pouches are stored exposed to the air. Becuase of this I keep them in a seald plastic tub and I use them up pretty quickly anyway.<br /><br />I buy them from Amazon because I can't get it locally and Amazon always has it for a great price and quick delivery.
351182	B003XBBAUM	A1CRC1LD9AKAGS	Dr.S	2	2	5	1335830400	Wonderful sweetner...even great for baking	I purchased a canister of this raw coconut crystals at my local organic market.  I think it is great!  The local shop has been out for a couple weeks, and so I have come to Amazon to order some, as I can't wait until they get it back in stock.  The price was similar.<br /><br />I have been using this in my tea and coffee when I want it sweetened.  Unlike some reviewers, I found that I need much less of this sweetner than I need of sugar.  It does not tastes as sweet, but it has a taste/flavor.  And maybe that registers with me and so I need less?  I don't know.  I am also looking to consume less sugar, and am gradually needed things to be less and less sweet as a result.  This is a good think.<br /><br />I was interested in the idea that it is lower glycemic compared to sugar, and that it has vits/minerals, is GMO-free and vegan.  My doctor thinks I may be insulin resistant, so I am looking to drastically reduce sugar consumption.  But I still love to bake and cook.  As I said, I use this in my beverages, and I have also baked with it.  I made some sprouted grain zucchini bread that was delicious.  I substituted 1/2 cup of sugar for 1/4 cup of this coconut crystals.  It was sooo yummy.  Not super sweet but full of great flavor.  I also used it as a substituion in some sprouted grain cranberry pistachio muffins that were divine.  Again, I used half of the quantity of coconut crystals compared to sugar.  Flavor was great.  I am ordering here on Amazon because I want to try it with some cookies and see how they turn out.  So far, I am loving it!<br /><br />For those that are looking for healthier alternatives, I'd say give it a try.  If you want the super sugary sweet taste, this may not be for you.

94863	B0087GG8OG	A1PJX7Y2V3SICE	AndreaF	1	1	3	1343692800	It is definitely dark roast	I love dark roast coffee, served with or without cream/sugar, and this Sumatran k-cup is most assuredly a dark roast, but I found the flavor and aroma of this product to register as slightly bitter/burnt.  It did not overwhelm my senses, and it was easily alleviated and made better with the use of creamer, but it still wasn't my favorite of the K-Cups that are available.  I thought it was "okay".<br /><br />My husband didn't enjoy the Starbucks version of Sumatra, stating that he felt it had a somewhat chemical-like aftertaste even with cream and sugar.  We used over half of the box, to make sure that our opinion wasn't perhaps based on a faulty serving or two, but ended up giving the remainder to our neighbors; unfortunately, this Sumatra just didn't work for us.

160042	B0062Q53U8	A2H2I5FY1PUHP1	Boilermate	2	5	1	1342569600	Turned Rancid	I first reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEHQV8">these crackers for the Amazon Vine program in January, 2012,</a> listed as being sold in packs of six. Below are my original and updated comments:<br /><br />***** Original Comments *****<br /><br />Nabisco Premium saltines have been *the* saltine in our household since my childhood, so I was eager to try this new variety. It turns out this is more than just new convenient packaging.<br /><br />First of all, like most "New and Improved" these days, "New" really means "Less per Package." While the standard package of four full-sized sleeves of crackers weighs in at 16 oz., this new packaging holds only 13.6oz. There are only 24 servings per box vs. 30. Minus one star for that. Having said that, I like everything else about this product. The smaller sized sleeves helps keep crackers from going stale.<br /><br />When I tried the crackers, I thought they seemed crisper than "normal" so I compared them to the old style I had in the cabinet. Sure enough, these are different. These crackers are thinner. A stack of five of these is equivalent to four of the old. They are a bit crispier compared to the old version.<br /><br />A check of the ingredients shows a new recipe, too. Unlike the old version, which contain HFCS, these have no sugar at all. The new crackers have a slightly higher calorie count/serving, as well as a bit more fat. The sodium count, however, is down.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like this new version and will buy them when they hit the stores here.<br /><br />*****************<br />UPDATE 07/18/2012<br />*****************<br />Reducing my rating from four stars to one.<br /><br />I stored these crackers as I have all saltine crackers for the past 25 years, and the same way my mother did when I was a child...in a metal box styled to look like a Nabisco Saltine box. They kept unopened sleeves of crackers from going stale or eaten by mice.<br /><br />I opened the next to last sleeve today and discovered the crackers had turned rancid. When saltines go stale the smell ok but taste flat and have little crunch. These had a decided rancid odor and taste, but were just as crunchy as the first sleeve. Never experienced this from Nabisco Saltines, and I've been eating them over 50 years.<br /><br />I am assuming Nabisco sent Amazon factory-fresh crackers to be evaluated, so considering the short time I've had them I am truly disappointed. Unfortunately I tossed the box when I put them in the tin. When I called Nabisco CS I was told I was the first one to report this (what a surprise!). They made no offer to replace the defective crackers, offer coupons, or even ask my name. So not much Customer Service, either.
554352	B007OXJKF2	A2U6RDV7RPDHCA	D. Stewart	0	0	3	1320019200	OK, but Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry is better	I bought this because I only needed 24 K-Cups and I could only get the Timothy's in a 48 pack.  It's OK, I don't really taste much of cinnamon flavor, and to me, there's a weird artificial aftertaste.  I'll definitely finish the package, but I won't reorder these.

A bit dry and powdery. That's a good thing, for not tempting me to over-indulge. But I wouldn't serve them at a party full of gluten-eaters.
58797	B000MIFS3Y	A1698F3EW48HJD	N. Merriam	0	0	5	1283817600	as good as you'd hope	These cups are a perfect size for a snack or lunch. It tastes exactly like the canned ravioli, which is either good or bad depending on your taste. I love that the container is not heat conductive (it is similar to stryrofoam), so it is easy to pick up and handle even when it is very hot, though you'll need to watch out for the metal ring on the lip. I wouldn't want kids heating these up on their own since they are very full and I could easily see an accident happening pulling it out of the microwave and taking the lid off.<br /><br />I keep these at work in a desk drawer for those days when i just don't have time for anything else. It is true comfort food for those of us who loved it as a kid! It would be great for a dorm room.<br /><br />The cups seem very waterproof and durable, and if worse comes to worst you could eat it without even heating, so we keep a half-dozen in our hurricane supply box.

128885	B000ID34WU	A1F7SX3GNVBNE3	Joshua G. Feldman "Technophile"	2	2	5	1325635200	Very good quality Jasmine tea balls.	I've had quite a few different jasmine tea pearls and they come in a variety of grades.  These superior grade specimens from Summit are just that.  They average around 8mm-1cm in diameter (large) and have an extremely pungent and fresh jasmine aroma.  In the cup they unfurl into whole young spring needle leaves.  The liquor is an inviting pale yellowish green with moderate to strong tannin and a rich flavor strongly redolent of jasmine blossoms.<br /><br />I drink this kind of tea in a tall cup.  I put 6-10 pearls in the bottom and let the leaves unfurl there (i.e. I do not use an infuser and I do not remove the leaves while I drink the tea).  Unlike most green teas this doesn't get too bitter with an extended time in the cup.  In this way it is like a green wulong.  Because of the strong flavor, this tea can be infused multiple times.<br /><br />The quality of jasmine tea pearls varies.  Some are small and hard.  Some are infused with only jasmine oil and some include blossoms.  This example is among the better ones obtainable in terms of size and grade of the leaves and the quality of the floral scent.  Recommended.
325684	B005VOOQHS	A2BPB05QNCE00B	Stacey B.	0	0	5	1328140800	Yum!	It has been a while since I have had koolaid. I remember when I was younger my mom didn't like to buy it, because they only sold the packets that you had to add sugar to and she didn't want us drinking all that sugar. Now that Koolaid comes in the tubs with the sugar already included, it is much easier to deal with. We now have the option to make just one glass at a time, rather than having to create a whole pitcher because we have to add sugar.<br /><br />I am a big fan of peach flavor, and this peach mango Koolaid is no exception. The taste is great! There is the perfect blend of mango versus peach. I love that I can add the amount of powder that I prefer and someone else can make a glass at the same time and add the amount of powder that they like.

I started researching what is in the dogfood and treats we give our pets and you do NOT want to give these to your dog. Look at the ingredients.  PROPYLENE GLYCOL is the same chemical as car anti-freeze which is lethal to animals. Why is it in there? You also do not want to see BHA in your pet treats, this is a known cancer causing preservative.  It is listed twice. Look up on the internet to find out what "animal digest" is before you feed it to your dog.<br /><br />I thought I was giving my dog healthy stuff made especially for him by a company that loves animals, not so! Give your pets natural foods and treats for their well being. It will only cost you a few dollars more. Don't make the mistake I made by giving my pet so many chemicals.

The granola clusters are nicely sized without being too "crumbly" or too hard.  They give a nice satisfying crunch even after sitting in milk for a bit and are a great accompaniment to yogurt.  I only wish that the cinnamon was a bit stronger in flavor, but the overall balance of flavors is quite satisfactory.<br /><br />What I like best is that you feel satisfied after eating a serving of this granola and are not hungry within the next hour or two like you are with some other granola brands.

It comes packaged like "Tussy" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just "lick" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange "treat". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.

It seemed that no matter how conscious i was of how i ate, my tummy still was huge. i knew my digestive system wasn't working properly.  I didn't like the way i felt after every meal, no matter how small the portion is, i felt like my tummy was about to burst! I chanced on Heather's Fennel tea while doing an online research of my symptoms, out of frustration. I ordered it, and have been enjoying the benefits of this tea for a month now. I am so glad I gave this product a chance. I drink it thrice a day during meals, and my tummy is a lot flatter now, not bulging as much, and my waist line is getting smaller every week, no more constipation. Another pro that I noticed, and I hope that this will continue, is that my PMS is not as bad. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I put some of it on chicken, let it marinate and grilled it.  It has quite a unique taste, and I'm not sure if I like it or not.  Also it wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be<br /><br />If you know you like jerk chicken, then I'd say to go for it.  This stuff is the real deal, made with the traditional ingredients.<br /><br />Edit:  I have used this seasoning on pork several times, it is fantastic.  Don't really know why it is so much better on pork than chicken.  Be careful using an indoor grill pan with this, sometimes it make choking hot pepper fumes if the heat is too high.
271816	B000EDK67K	A3LG7LFWZCMPBK	Karen M. Bryant "karen"	1	1	5	1340841600	cheaper in bulk	This non-fat milk product is excellent.  It is easy to mix (with a mixer or blender) and tastes fine.  It is not vitamin D fortified, which matters to me.  Quality and delivery are excellent (I love Amazon).  I use a fairly large amount of dry milk powder & have been ordering it through Amazon's subscription program.  I was absolutely satisfied except I thought I could surely find it for less money.  I did, and I'm about to tell you about it.<br /><br />This product is about $.43/oz from this vendor on Amazon.  I was able to find it at $.13/oz at an LDS Storehouse.  It is practically unacceptable except in terms of quality and price. I use enough of this that I bought 25# in bulk.  The LDS storehouse will allow you to repackage it in their facility in #10 cans that will last for 20 years (which I'm sure is important to some people).  It is worth the inconvenience and hassle (and it is both, although it is also educational) because I can save so much (70% reduction in price if I buy 25#).  you can also buy it in individual #10 cans (about 4#) for a little less than $9.00 per can.<br /><br />So here's the bottom line.  This is a great product, convenient and delivered to your door at a reasonable price.  But if you get nuts about it, you can find it at a significant savings.

I had a favorite recipe and just substituted this Bob's GF flour.  The recipe called for 2 cups of flour, so I used 1 3/4 cups of this product and 1/4 cup of Hazelnut flour(ground hazelnut).  As I was mixing it, I did notice it smelled a little odd--a smell I didn't care for.  From reading some other reviews, I'm guessing it's the bean flour.  But I stuck to the recipe, adding sour cream, cinnamon, natural vanilla extract, etc.  Baked it.  When it was cool, I was a little nervous, but when I tasted it, I thought it tasted great.  My mom thought it was delicious and wanted to take some home, even my fast-food loving husband said it was really good and "doesn't taste gluten free."  Not that he's really had any gluten free baked goods.<br /><br />The texture was good.  It didn't rise as much as regular flour, so no spilling in the oven.  Baking time took longer than my original recipe.  Small muffins took about 30 minutes and the glass loaf pan took over an hour.  But on both the texture was good, moist(though a bit more crumbly) and no odd taste or smell in the finished product(despite the smell noticed when I was mixing the batter).  I think I prefer the muffins because they were done sooner and, thus, less brown on top.  Then I just pop them into the toaster oven the next day and they're like fresh baked.<br /><br />I really liked the result for sweets with this product!
34544	B0018CJJ9W	A29LLQMJP8BDPG	Carol R. Slicher "psych303"	15	15	5	1274918400	Excellent Allergy Response!	My 10 year old cocker spaniel has been treated for chronic ear and paw yeast infections for the past 9 years.  He's had chronic, stinky black gunk in his ears and a black waxy substance covering his toes.  I would guess that I've spent thousands of dollars on vet visits, tests, shampoos, ear medications, wipes, antibiotics - you name it - none of which worked for more than a week.  My vet even tried a "new" process where the dog's ears were filled with some type of medication every week (at the vets - $50 a week) for a couple of months - but there was no improvement.  My poor dog has scratched himself raw and spent much of his day licking and digging at his yeast-encrusted paws or scratching his sore, smelly ears.  Recently, I've been bathing him every 2 days with Malaseb Shampoo (which did seem to help), but he had to stand for 15 minutes with the shampoo covering him, before the medication could be rinsed from his skin.  Poor little dog.<br /><br />While on a trip to Florida, I took my spaniel to a new vet who prescribed more ear drops, wipes, and shampoo in an attempt to help my dog.  The vet  asked me if I'd ever tried changing his food from Eukanuba, which he's been on since he was a puppy.  No vet had ever mentioned that my dog could be allergic to his food and it seemed so simple.  I found Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison at Petco and thought I'd try a food trial.  What a difference!  In the two weeks since he's been on this dog food his yeast infection appears to be gone.  His ears are clear, with no discharge or irritation and the skin on his paws is starting to look pink and healthy.  I can't believe the difference in such a short time!  He's not scratching, either.  The Florida vet had said that a food trial would require at least 2 months, but I'm seeing such an improvement in only 2 weeks.  Pretty amazing!

343878	B008J1HO4C	A3GX7EVYDJZTWJ	Shamus O'Reilly	1	1	5	1184716800	My Favorite Oatmeal	McCann's steel cut oatmeal is the real deal.  Unlike most products which have a plastic or paper container, McCann's still comes in an easy to open tin which a person can use for many things after the oats are long gone.  The oatmeal is not for a person in a hurry as you need almost 30 minutes to prepare.  But the cooked oatmeal is well worth waiting for.  Unlike rolled oatmeal which to me makes a mushy product which I won't eat, steel cut oats actually retain some of their shape after being cooked.  Since I've started eating oatmeal regularly, my total cholesterol has dropped 20 points!  McCann's steel cut oatmeal have a long shelf life, so I'm not afraid of buying a 4-pack or even two 4-packs when they are on special.  I've seen one can go for over $6 in some special food markets.  Enjoy!

Mulvany "eponaflora"	5	6	1	1258588800	Caused Both My Cats to Have Diarrhea	I have a 15 year old neutered male domestic short hair and a 15 year old spayed female domestic short hair, who are both overall very healthy and happy. I was excited to put my cats on this food after doing extensive research because it was high in protein, grain-free and had several great reviews. I had them on Innova Senior, but it was a little dry and they didn't really "love" the food. However, since starting to feed Wellness CORE a few days ago, my kitties have both had diarrhea every time they use the litterbox. I've owned both cats their entire lives, and they've never had diarrhea before and it's the only thing that's changed in their diet (they also get Wellness wet food at night). Although I already have them on a relatively high protein, low carb diet, I think the even higher level of protein and fat in this food might be too much for their digestive tracts to handle. I have stopped feeding this food and expect the condition to clear up soon.

Let me tell you, there is almost no comparison with the non-fat milk we drink here in the states. This stuff is way better. Don't quote me on this, but I heard that Nido isn't 100% non-fat. That being the case, it doesn't keep as long as non-fat powdered milk. But I might be wrong. At any rate, it's worth it. If you really want to make it taste good just add a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up.

The browns tend to be more natural.  The color was one strike.  The dogs don't need it, they can't see it anyway. Another thing is the corn.  With corn being the main ingredient, it can't be healthy.  Who eats that much corn in a meal.  If dogs were out in the wild, they sure wouldn't walk up to a cornfield and think, yum! corn.  They would chase down the mice first!<br /><br />The dogs did eat it but they weren't excited about it. Back to our old brand.

I am glad I got the sample size of this one as it is the worst of the lot so far. It tastes super bitter, although, I did not mix fruit with it like the directions say, so perhaps it would be better with fruit. It also irritates my throat for some reason, in fact at first I thought I was having some kind of reaction, but it has subsided since I've started writing this review.<br /><br />Like everyone else is saying, this 'protein' shake doesn't have much protein. Compared to the other shakes I've been trying, it has the least amount by % weight.<br /><br />I think that it's unfair for the marketers to put delicious in the label as it is far from delicious.

It is rather pricy, and yet I found it on sale, so I thought. I have plenty of caribou and that should hold me for a while until the seasonal coffees come out, hopefully they will not be so high in price. Saw a review on the Kcup coffees and found that they got the rating of being simply just "ok", so it is more of the easy of making the coffee rather than the price or quality of the brew of coffee. I shall keep my eyes peeled for the cheapest place to buy my kcups. The day break of the caribou is the best variety of the caribou brand.

536885	B0081XIAUK	A11IDK9L74LPT1	C. Schmidt	10	11	2	1336176000	Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.	I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning "nosework" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective "nosing the flap" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2"x2" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could "find" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she "finds" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-

And, then, for whatever reason, they'll want a change. This duck and green pea is always a hit with my shorthair. It is a lot different from the other flavors, and he never ever grows tired of it. This is a smooth creamy cat food, with a lot of moisture in it -- highly recommended for adult male cats prone to urinary problems. Those males often don't drink enough water, so this food helps by adding some water to their diet.

The other, developed terrible ear problems over time, after trying other remedy's we finally started changing foods, and found Wellness brand cleared up the ear problem within days! Sometimes mild ear irritations would come back, although in a very mild form as compared to before.<br /><br />A few months ago, we decided to try the Wellness Chicken, and the ear problems are gone. Another benefit is, so is their Gas!<br /><br />The dogs love the food, are still just as active, and look just as healthy as they always have. Plus they love helping open the box that the food comes in when picked up off of the front porch!<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon and Prime we do not have to search pet stores that are always out of this stuff, and we can have dog food on our doorstep within 2 days! All of this without paying crazy shipping costs.<br /><br />Keep it up Amazon, and Wellness.
449624	B001D0GVAO	A1UXVA66S5TIW4	Christopher Bowers "cbamity"	1	2	1	1297123200	Nothing like Big Easy Bold	Apparently alot of folks like this product, but I have to say... its terrible.  I tend to drink dark roasts, and have been on a search for a good decaf Kcup for a while now.  I have to admit I have found very few decafs that are drinkable (coffee people's decaf French Roast is pretty good, and Timothy's decaf espresso is drinkable).  Since I thought Emeril's Big Easy bold was surprisingly decent, I thought this would be a decaf version- but its not even close.  Maybe its me, but I've sampled a half dozen decaf dark roasts, and this one is the worst of the bunch.  During brewing it starts off dark, but quickly becomes watery, lacking body.  The resulting drink tastes to me like someone ran the water trough the coffee twice, and I'm drinking the second cup.

135914	B003XV3EY2	A3GWM1FHA3EQPM	Marianne O. Schmidt	0	0	4	1350518400	Good But Different	I must agree with the first reviewer that it didn't spread as easily as the CheezWhiz in the jar.  It is a lot thicker than it used to be.  At one time we could buy the cans in our local Cubs stores in the Twin Cities, but they have since stopped carrying them.  Then, it was exactly the same as the CheezWhiz in the jars, and very spreadable.  Now I have to scoop a little out to soften in the microwave before I use it, if I want to spread it on a sandwich or crackers.  The taste is about right to me and I do use this product on everything: sandwiches, sauces, casseroles, you name it.  I really love CheezWhiz and I will purchase the can again when I run out of the other one.  It would be handy to store if they still came with the big plastic lid.  I have made my own CheezWhiz in the past, and if you make your own you can control how thin or thick it is.  If you want to make your own, cube a two pound log of Velveeta, and add it to the top of a double boiler, along with a cup of milk, a stick of butter or margarine, a pinch of sugar, and that's it.  You cook it on low heat, give it a stir now and then, and at the end you have a CheezWhiz like product.  I generally used more than one cup of milk when I made it.  When my kids were small, it was cheaper to make it, now it's about the same price, so I just buy it.

The gum has a weird flavor, something like sweetened gasoline. Gum has a 9/12/13 expiration date so I expected it to be soft and easy to chew, but it was the opposite. Gum was hard and loss its sweetness after a couple of chews. It also left an aftertaste that I couldn't get rid of even after brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. Last but not least, though its sugar-free it is not low calorie; each piece of gum is 20 calories. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this... most likely will toss the entire lot in the garbage. What a disappointment and waste of money.

In terms of a flavor, spearmint isn't my first choice in gum, yet I find it tolerable.  The spearmint flavor here was faint and vague to the point that it annoyed my taste buds because it was just mild enough to feel like I'm awkwardly drinking a squirt of toothpaste stirred into 16 ounces of water.

It's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs/noodles in cream sauce.  It's better than the horribly taste-free chicken/dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all I've tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  "Light" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, it's middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK.

321278	B008RWUHA6	A28RHTOOW04O6M	Ella "Ella K"	0	0	3	1319500800	Unremarkable in taste or quality	Some highlights:<br />* Not too sweet, just right<br />* Not too salty either<br />* Some clusters like would be in granola, but not many<br />* Doesn't smell like vanilla or blueberry at all<br /><br />Overall, it has a bland and unremarkable taste.  I have tried much better granola in the past with a better nutritional profile.<br />Actually, it's hard to assess the nutritional profile since the "Nutrition Facts" do not show accurate data.  For example, one of the ingredients is Vitamin E, but it's not listed under the nutrition facts.  Which makes me think that anything could be there (or not be there).<br /><br />Also, the smell when I opened the package was anything but appealing.  No hints of vanilla or blueberries.

I tried three bags of this product but have been surprised by how consistently dry the beans are in each shipment.  It is the messiest bean I have ever ground.  The quality of the coffee is not on par with less expensive beans purchased at the grocer.  The taste is okay but it doesn't rise to the level that you should expect.  Royal Kona at Wal-Mart, believe it or not, is a better product.  I am really disappointed because I like the convenience of the Amazon subscription service.  But, the product doesn't measure up.

The Duck Jerky you get from Wal-Mart is at least moist and chewy. I am not happy and neither is my puppy (tough chewing).

68940	B0018KR8V0	A3UO2SU0D533YS	Justin Gerhard	1	1	5	1305072000	tasty	At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars. I'm torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price. One of each makes a good cheap lunch @ $1.60.
14306	B001CWV4PA	A34U8UOJOPR0DQ	K. Dvorak	9	10	3	1251158400	Better than nothing	These crackers serve a purpose and have an okay taste although they are kind of bland.  I usually eat them with salami and cheese so the flavor from the other products helps.  These crackers are the best ones I've found on the market so will continue to buy them.  They also are closest to a Ritz cracker in size, shape, and crunch.  The other crackers I've tried leave an aftertaste and are paper thin.
457550	B001CWX7EG	A30JYOIR0U7KSG	D. Vieira	2	3	2	1308441600	Potato-y taste, bad texture	In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a "real" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than "real" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to "real" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists.

Okay, I LOVE Oregon Chai, but I've always bought the powdered packets, and I had heard that the liquid was better.  NOT SO.  This stuff tasted like condensed milk, it's so sweet it's terrible.  With the powdered tea, you get a rich blend of spices and aromas, with this stuff, you get sugar water.  I was really disappointed- I went straight back to the powder and I'll be giving away the 5 unopened boxes.  Maybe it would make a good flavored coffee syrup or something.  My recommendation?  BUY THE POWDER!  You won't regret it!

I found this product and now I eat some almost every day!  Plenty of protein and low calories.  The taste is wonderful and seasoning perfect.  Some have said it is expensive, but it is actual hunks of smoked salmon, you can't get that cheap!

To get the applied tape off, the paper put on by the manufacturer tore.  Obviously, this container will not be put on my table.

One is going to my sister-in-law who loves tea, but who also is an artist that I think will really be in awe by this set.<br /><br />The care in the packaging of this item was the first thing to impress me. It came in the standard Amazon box, then another cardboard box, then wrapped in a heavy tissue paper and finally the set itself.<br /><br />Once I carefully got through all of the above, I found a very nice bamboo box with a picture of what was inside.  I decided I needed to peek in so that I could see for myself. The box has button like clasps on the side to keep it closed and when opened the teapot is snuggled in with a box of tea surrounded crinkly brown paper.<br /><br />As I said in my review title, I cannot rate the tea that comes with this set, which is why I only give it 4 stars.  Although if you look at the flowering tea sold separately from Numi here on Amazon you can see that it received an average 4 star review. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFS0CA">Numi Tea Petite Bouquet Sampler Flowering Tea, 4 Count Sampler (Pack of 12)</a>

450917	B001OCKIBY	A3CG93783LP0FO	Yarii	0	1	5	1245628800	Very tasty!	I was a little hesitant in trying these Triple Nut Bars since I'm not a big fan of almonds, however, I haven't found all that many almonds in them.  Plenty of honey roasted peanuts and quite a large amount of broken up cashews, I love these!  I eat them slowly to savor the flavor, because they really are good.<br /><br />These granola bars are a little larger in size than the standard, 4-1/2" long by 1-1/14" wide by 5/8" thick.  Just salty enough to make them delicious, and sticky enough so it doesn't break apart when biting into one.  Yet not so sticky that you have to wash your hands after eating.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

The taste alone would make this tea worth drinking, but the mint and other flavors make it especially soothing.  It also helps quiet a cough.  This is a lovely tea with benefits!

I was so disappointed in the flavor of this product! It has very little licorice taste and an almost sickening after taste and smell. I added sugar to it as I did not find it very sweet. I ordered the 6 box pack of this so I guess I have 5 boxes of it to give away
321351	B008RWUHA6	A2POYXTGSPSW7O	William A. Hensler	1	1	4	1320278400	Not bad at all	I ordered a bag and it works just fine on Greek yogurt.  It's light, not too sweet, and adds a good something to a yogurt product.<br /><br />The next day I had this product with skim milk.  It's not bad for breakfast.  Lots of granola products are very dry.  For some reason this product isn't dry at all and is fairly good.<br /><br />Now, I knocked off a star for the flax seed.  I'm not used to that seed and it left a different taste.  The oats, blueberries, and brown sugar was pleasant.  The flax is different, not bad, but different.<br /><br />Still, this is a good product and I will buy more.
