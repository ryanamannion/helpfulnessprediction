365891	B003VE3IEW	AP6TCND7WLWYW	D.S.W.	0	0	3	1341532800	Wasn't exactly what i hoped for.	I thought it'd be like the tamarindo mexican style candies, but i was wrong. It's ok, but it's certainly not what i thought it was.
560571	B000CQID1K	A5OEMGI2Q70V0	M. Rocha "Prime Rocks!"	3	3	2	1196553600	Bursting with goo....	I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra "oomph" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese.

Its slightly sweet scent is not that "Hawaiian Tropic" tourist scent; this is very nice and subtle.  The oil is absorbed rather quickly into my skin so that it's never slippery.  Quick shipping.  Thanks!

Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She "cautiously" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says "You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and "no way!" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage "dining room". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his "Happy" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to "shop around" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne
280019	B000ER5CTS	A3R6GLR5RLZ7F3	Kristen Kornacki	0	0	5	1281916800	My baby loves these!	My son has been eating these since he was 7.5 months old and had 8 teeth (he is 11 months now). He absolutely loves them! I love that they are organic (obviously) and that they come in packs of 2. I never leave the house without throwing a pack in our backpack - they've saved me from many meltdowns!<br />Could they pose a choking hazard? Yes. But I have never had an issue and he eats at least 3 of these a week. As with any snack, you have to watch your baby like a hawk. Mine has not choked once.

491829	B004DBOJUY	A2MBQJG3W8G83Q	Healthnut	1	1	5	1291334400	What a Godsend!!!	I have tried to stay off of sugar and white refined things for years but giving up the occasional sweet delights was hard.  This amazing "smart sugar" has changed my life and brought better health and freedom.  Not only have I been able to stabilize my blood sugar which is critical for my weight control and all disease for that matter as Jorge Crews so succinctly presented in his best seller, The Belly Fat Cure, but I have found that substituting Sweet Matters xylitol crystals for sugar in all recipes has completely stopped newly developing joint pain.  Since xylitol, unlike sugar, does not stimulate my pancreas to release insulin and is alkalizing in my system instead of acid producing like sugar,it has been a huge factor in keeping the inflammatory process at bay in my body. Oh yes, this smart sugar is huge in Europe and been the healthy alternative for years. Not only is it not bad for me but it has many health giving benefits. Got to love it!!!

The price is definitely affordable and the cherries are worth every cent.<br />I love the cranberries more (and give them a 10) but these cherries are definitely a 9.99 :)))<br />Arrived QUICK and in excellent shape.<br />Thank-you Amazon!
98940	B005QRPH78	A392P34QSBUICZ	Robin Landry "Robin Landry"	0	0	5	1320364800	Daisy likes them	I give 5 stars to anything my dog likes because she's so picky.  People will give her a doggy snack/biscuit and she'll let it drop out of her mouth and onto the ground. So embarrassing.  When I first gave her one of the Zoe Low Calorie chew sticks, she trotted off with it and then laid it down, seemingly forgotten.  I was was ready to say she didn't like them, but, when I gave the stick back to her during her brushing(I have give her something to chew on so she doesn't chew on me), she gobbled it up, and in fact, it took 3 sticks to get through her half hour brush-out(she's a rough collie, like Lassie).<br /><br />Though  Zoe treats are low calorie, something my dog doesn't have to worry about, they still apparently taste good.  They smell like doggy-treat with cinnamon to me, nothing I'd want to eat, but then I'm not the one testing the product.<br /><br />These treats are gluten-free, something I watch out for with my dog because collies are prone to skin problems.  The ingredients are as listed:<br />Brown rice flour<br />organic quinoa flour, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch(I've heard this is good in prevent cancer)oat fiber, oat groats, chicken, natural chicken flavor, calcium carbonate, organic flaxseed, carrots, chia seed, cinnamon, carrogeenan, furtooligosachride(A natural probiotic found in bananas), L-carnitrine(helps turn fat into energy).<br /><br />With all this good stuff going on, I wish the kids were still young enough to get them to eat these sticks.  It would be a whole lot healthier than most of the human snacks out there.  And they were never as picky as Daisy.
300040	B000WFRYWU	A3RNRXOM5J2C93	Jeffrey E. Cornett	1	1	4	1332892800	Wellnes Dog Food	It is a good dog food.  Our dogs stools have become normal since using it.  My only complaint is when you open the can there is a gell similar to when you open a can of Spam, which has to be scraped off and you lose some dog food because of the space taken by the gel.
152550	B001ECQBVA	AFDA6WY9A6JEG	Vetterun	1	1	5	1312934400	No Miss with Planters Mixed	The Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts made with Pure Sea Salt are a quality snack and help explain what has made me a loyal Planters consumer for many years.  The two-day shipping with Amazon Prime and  Amazon subscriber pricing make for an even greater value.
8736	B003VXFK44	A3K9YKYVGEENPI	Beth	1	1	3	1317772800	Okay but not great	This coffee is okay but certainly not as good as Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend. It just doesn't taste as good.
460231	B005BRHVD6	A2BUAE2YCSPUGC	Soccer Mom "Soccer Mom"	3	4	5	1155168000	GU Energy Gel - Great for sports atheletes	I was introduced to this product by an AYSO referee when my daughter collapsed on the field during a game.  He gave her the GU and within 5 minutes, she was back to being able to perform on the field.  We have been using it ever since.
166034	B002O039JI	A35OGHKUSMOOTO	CB	0	0	5	1346803200	Excellent - don't get the reviews.	This coffee is great - reminds me of what I get in Dubai and the Middle East.  Easy to make.  No problems.  I also love the Capuccino and Latte - definitely coffee house coffee at home.  And everyone I've made if for has agreed that it is fabulous!<br /><br />I've read the reviews and I think people don't follow instructions or know what they are doing.  This has one pod - it has no milk pod.  You put it in, set the machine on the correct number of bars corresponding to what is on the pod, and push the button.  Viola.  It is done.  And if there is a milk pod (like for the latte) you use BOTH a milk and a coffee pod not just the milk pod.<br /><br />You will love this coffee and machine!

32460	B001AJ1ULS	A2WO120HF09ZI2	Thoughtful Reader	0	0	1	1347494400	WARNING-NO RETURNS ACCEPTED	I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals.
438633	B005HGAV8I	A3CDFH1Z9EYQ55	#collegestudent	0	0	5	1350777600	Pleasantly Surprised!! (and Kosher)	I recently purchased a Keurig machine and wasn't cure what kind of K-cups I should get.<br />I didn't want to commit to a large box of one flavor because<br />A. I like variety and B. What if I didn't like the flavor?<br /><br />So, despite many awful reviews, I decided to take a risk and order this project.<br />And like the title says, I was pleasantly surprised!<br />The product came in a rectangular box, not the paper bag many reviewers were offended by, and the K-Cups were nicely organized inside.<br />I received a wide variety of K-Cups from different companies. While many of them were vanilla or caramel, even those came in a variety of blends and companies.<br />Also included were several cappuccino K-Cups, which I didn't even know existed.<br />Additionally, considering it was fall, I received two Pumpkin Spice K-Cups - Yum!<br />2 Brooklyn Maple Sleigh<br />2 Brooklyn Hazelnut<br />2 Brooklyn Vanilla Skyline<br />1 Green Mountain Mocha Nut Fudge<br />1 Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />2 Green Mountain Island Coconut - Limited Edition<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla Decaf<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />1 Green Mountain Hazelnut Decaf<br />1 Green Mountain French Vanilla Iced Coffee<br />1 Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette<br />1 Green Mountain Caramel Creme Vanilla<br />2 Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice - Limited Edition<br />1 Green Mountain Southern Pecan<br />2 Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino - Dairy<br />2 Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino - Dairy<br />2 Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino- Dairy<br />2 Kahlua Original<br />1 Gloria Jean's Mudslide<br />1 Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme<br />1 Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee<br />1 Gloria Jean's Hazelnut<br />1 Wolfgang Puck Jamaica Me Crazy<br />1 Donut Shop Collection Cinnamon Roll<br />1 Donut Shop Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut<br /><br />As well as a couple others that I have already drank and don't recall which they were.<br /><br />Overall I was very pleased with the variety I received and none of the included cups were expired, damaged or dried out in any way.<br />Would definitely order again and suggest it to others!<br /><br />P.S. All of the included K-Cups were certified Kosher.
109942	B007PA30ZU	A2NBVE6CVHFIY0	C. Symons	34	36	5	1275091200	Truly great coffee	The Keurig system is marvelous--and the Dark Magic coffee is delicious. But Amazon is falling down on the job a bit with this price--you can buy a box of 24 K cups from the Keurig site for $13.95--and get a discount as muc as 15% if you are a repeat buyer.
