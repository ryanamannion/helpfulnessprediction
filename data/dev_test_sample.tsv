My daughter fulfilled all the "requirements" listed on the box, e.g. she can crawl, gums food, etc., but she still got a big piece of these stuck in her throat and started chocking. There is nothing more scary than finding your nanny hold your child upside down trying to get a piece of food out.<br />I don't recommend these. They should be recalled, or at least not called "teething" biscuits, more like "toddler" biscuits.

We've tried 3 Fruitables varieties - pumpkin/apple, pumpkin/cranberry, and pumpkin/blueberry - and the pooch craves them all. As he has kidney disease, it is very important that his treats are low in protein and fat, and these treats follow the specifications of what we should be feeding him perfectly! As other reviewers have mentioned, they smell so good it's hard to believe they're not meant for human consumption... I haven't had the nerve to actually try one... yet. I would highly recommend them!

However, they are a far cry from this. They are really a smashed blend of many ingredients bent back into a pea shape. There are a few benefits like fiber and there is some sort of pea in it but overall there are still some poor ingredients in my opinion, especially when I was expecting dried snap peas. Also, the flavor was very bland. Almost like cheerios, or a stale corn puff. Somewhat overpriced too, although I bought them from the grocery store not Amazon. I wouldn't recommend them.

The Bonsai Tree I chose to have delivered came on January 5 instead of the promised January 7th. Being shipped in the dead of winter, I expected some leaf drop, absolutely none. Leaves were green as could be and soil was still damp after two days in a package. The package was well packed, cardboard and peanuts everywhere that could be imagined. Everything about this purchase was way above my expectations. Thank you.

These are expensive so I buy my kids pretzel's at the grocery store.  I can say these taste 10X better than any that I have had (regular / with gluten) - they have a fabulous taste.  I would recommend these if you like Pretzels - even if you can eat gluten they just taste great

184076	B00764BRS2	A1IW9LSLZFW9FK	Average Joe Schmo	1	1	3	1331251200	Never as good as the K-Cup	These are a pain in the rear, you need to take your used cup, empty it, make sure all the lid foil is off and then wash it good. Then fill it with coffee and then put lid on. It is like factory work and that is the last thing I want to do at 5am in the morning. The coffee never tastes as good as the K-cup. You can't reuse the K-cup too many times either as the filter inside rips or just wears out. There is one thing you must also remember...when you put your original k-cup in the first time unused, the machine punctured a hole in the bottom of cup, when you are going to put in your used cup with this lid you must line up the original hole else it will puncture a new one each time you use it. It does work OK but is it really worth the effort?....not to me.

One time she managed to unscrew the bottom, and with that experience, she fixated on the bottom as the "ultimate solution" for the last morsels that weren't coming out from tilting and dropping the toy.  She cracked through the hard plastic, breaking both the lid and the jug.  The toy is advertised for "heavy chewers" but the container obviously doesn't hold up.  I hope the store will offer a refund.

I've always been satisfied with what I got, after all, what can coconut oil be?  Then I tried this one.  It has a light, delicate flavor and a wonderful texture.  I use it in my hair, to shave, on my skin, to fry eggs, to mix with other ingredients.  It adds a nice touch to chocolate cake and goes well with most flavors of cheesecake.  I like this well enough to have a subscription.  First class stuff.

A really nice touch is the serrated lid so that you can tear off the lid and the side top flaps to get a nice container that fits perfectly in the kitchen drawer under the counter where my kettle is. But the main thing is that you get a decent cuppa, not some "titty" tea - as they would say in old England!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5Q3U">Tetley British Blend Premium Black, 80-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>
23456	B004R8J8E0	A2VJJ2POCLMED7	Marshall Carter "Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club Member"	0	0	4	1321401600	Good stuff, but not very much of it...	The Pork Shake N Bake has always been a simple way to make any old chop a good bit tastier. With minimal mess, trouble and time, you get healthier-than-fried breaded chops that are juicy and taste good. It's not exactly gourmet, but after a long day, it's an easy way to start a meal without having to resort to fast food. The seasoning in the Shake N Bake make the pork sufficiently tasty, but doesn't overpower it like some mixes can.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's that you may need more than one pouch if you're cooking more than 3 or 4 chops. I was probably being a bit liberal with them, but I had enough for three thick-cut boneless pork chops and there wasn't much left over (maybe a tablespoon). That's a minor gripe, but if you're cooking a lot of chops, especially thick ones, you're going to need more than a single pouch.

I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.

Then I fell in love with Chai, but found some chais too strong.<br /><br />This chai was a good introduction for me.<br /><br />One benefit of chai is less sugar is required.  The vanilla helps to soften the cinammon flavor.
234756	B000KV7ZGQ	A2M18TY5BOC3OC	Demiurgess	0	0	3	1296432000	Too easy	I have a dachshund/terrier mix who is 2 years old. I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.<br /><br />Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to break the koosh ball.

First off, you must know that a 30 pack of these lollis at Whole Foods is $4.99, so this is a steal. I love that they have added Vit C., because I only let my children have lollis if they do something REALLY special, or when they're sick.<br />My middle son has ADHD and we've had wild success following the Feingold Diet for him. That being said, finding candy that has zero artificial food coloring and no processed sugar is really hard to do. Enter Yummy Earth, and they save the day!<br />Also, the fact that they are labeled VEGAN is a big deal, as now I know that they do not have Castoreum in them for the cherry/strawberry flavoring. Castoreum is beaver anal gland juice, and it is considered a "natural flavor" according to the USDA.  It's nasty, and the only way you know for sure you're not eating anal juice is if the product is labeled VEGAN.  I am not opposed to eating meat at all - but anal juice? Really? Why not use the real berry or vanilla bean for the flavoring? Who thought of tasting and then using anal gland juice?<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of what we received:<br />326 lollis (well, 327, but one did not have a wrapper on it, so it went to the trash).<br />Apple -25<br />Cherry - 35<br />Pomegranate - 41<br />Grape -46<br />Blueberry - 50<br />Strawberry - 48<br />Watermelon - 41<br />Mango - 40<br /><br />My husband doesn't like the watermelon, but my kids & I enjoy them all!

If they are paired with scrambled eggs and a bagel then they already make up a perfect meal for me. I really like the products from Cedar Lake because they give vegetarians like me a wider option when it comes to what we can eat. In addition, these canned goodies contain very minimal preservatives to keep them healthy. That's why I feel safe eating these breakfast sausages as often as I could.

I thought this would be a good alternative to putting them under to have our vet clean their teeth.  I thought I had thoroughly investigated the ingredients beforehand.<br /><br />Luckily our cats were due for their annual check-up at our vet.  Our oldest cat, Aztec, is 10 years old.  Since she is a 'senior' cat she has blood drawn once a year to catch anything that might be going on with her.  Well, this time her liver levels were off.  I immediately poured the rest of this Breathalyser down the drain, not taking any chances in giving this product to our cats.<br /><br />I researched again, and found that zylitol causes serious problems for dogs, but there was no research showing a problem for cats.  I AM WRITING THIS TO INFORM CAT OWNERS NOT TO TAKE A CHANCE WITH THIS PRODUCT.  While I can't prove that Breatalyser caused this liver problem for Aztec, it's highly likely.  This is the only new thing that had been introduced to her diet.<br /><br />Aztec is now on a medication for her liver for a month.  Hopefully when she goes back to the vet, her liver levels will be back to normal.<br /><br />DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!

After reading about the tea and how it might help with IC, I found it at a local health food store last year.  It's no longer available locally, so I hoped to find in through Amazon.  This is not the same brand I used before, but can't help but think, it will be just as soothing.

Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though.
10124	B003EML8PM	ADQGF68CXJOTX	Maxine "Max"	0	0	5	1325116800	The Microwave Pork Rinds Are Surpisingly Fantastic	I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.<br /><br />It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.<br /><br />I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.

Both Mrs. Boilermate and I thought this was a decent cup. She drank hers plain, and I drank mine both plain and with lemon and sugar.

Works best on the #4 setting, is passable for #5 [travel mug].

We switched to this over a course of a few weeks without any issues.<br /><br />She is healthy with a nice coat being on this for 3 months.  She maintains her weight well on Innova and seems to be full whenever she gobbles down the bowl.  I agree with the reviewer who stated this is the least expensive of the best dog foods in pricing other higher end foods.<br /><br />We buy locally for $60 a bag and it seems to last awhile since its a higher quality nutrient dense food (I can update an exact time in the future).  You can spend less on a bag of food with fillers...and you probably will go through it quicker.<br /><br />It is worth the extra $$ in a healthier pet/member of our family.

She licks it, carries it around, bounces it, etc.  But the other dog tried to get the treat out and when she couldn't (and she's pretty tough)-- she lost interest.<br /><br />I'm leaving off a star because I think the price point is too high.  I've had just as much success entertaining and stimulating my dogs with other treat balls...like the Omega orange ball.  That one can be filled with a treat(food) of your choice and you're not bound to buy one specific filler.

I used my vanilla beans for making Banana ice cream, and it came out amazing.  The beans were still plump, and not hard like the ones in my grocery store.  Plus they were a fraction of the price, even when I only bought the 7 bean package.  Considerable amount of savings with the larger packages, I just wanted to make sure I would use them first.  They are about gone, so the next time I will be opting for the 1/2 or 1/4lb packages.

I normally use a different brand but was trying to save a few bucks. You all know gluten free baking is expensive!  So I make cupcakes to take to a picnic. I have used this recipe 100 times if not more. Never had an issue. Batch 1, a total disaster. I try again because I figure I was distracted. Batch 2 another flop.  I go, cupcakeless to the picnic. I try again Monday morning when everything is quiet and STILL a disaster. I order my normal brand and it gets here Wed. (thank you Amazon Prime ;) ) and use the same recipe and it turned out great!  I was shocked that a different brand could lead to such drastic differences in the final product!

I've had a chance to try this product now with several cats (I seem to be magnet for abandoned or lost cats).  While I haven't done a close-up assessment of the cleaning power of this product, I can say that unlike other brands, all of my picky cats immediately dove into these kibbles.  Even if the cleaning is no better than other products, the fact that my cats actually seem to like it will certainly result in cleaner fangs.  This is a product that I will buy on a regular basis.

I wasn't quite sure my cats would eat this because I've never fed them anything other than dry kibble.  I needn't have worried; my cats love it!<br /><br />I like that it has human grade ingredients (no bad odors here) and that it contains absolutely no gluten (the ingredient that caused a massive pet food recall a few years back).  Something I didn't know before ordering Petite Cuisine is that it comes in recyclable aluminum cans, which means it won't contribute to the overflowing landfill problem.<br /><br />All in all, my only complaint is the cost, but I will probably buy more for my cats as a special treat.  They will love me for it.

I tried all types of the natural litters (except the cedar kind, how it clumps worried me) I will not use clay because of the health risks to my cats. Green tea litter works the best! My house no longer smells like cats live there, it also has very minimal tracking (I use the modKat litter box). I absolutely love it, I was so frustrated with finding the right litter until I stumbled onto this one.<br />I try to scoop the litter boxes daily (longest I go is 2 days, but only when I'm ridiculously busy)<br /><br />PROS:<br />clumps well<br />low - no odor<br />tracks very little<br />flush-able (but not in large quantities)<br />Light enough to walk home from the store with<br />doesn't stick to my cats fur<br /><br />CONS:<br />sometimes my cats bat around a pellet or two on the floor<br />dusty out of the bag and while scooping<br /><br />OTHER BRANDS:<br />*The Sweatscoop litter tracked everywhere and attracted little bugs (I noticed them mainly in new boxes!) Urine would cause big clumps to stick to the bottom of the litter pan and scraping them off incited terror that chunks would fly up and hit me in the face (I had to use so much force that yes, chunks occasionally would fly, it was gross)<br />*The corn worlds best litter smelled so weird right out of the bag that I could not put up with it for more than a day! It clumped well, but tracked everywhere because it was so light, and also would get all over my kittens fur, not cool. The smell is the worst part though,The memory of it still makes me cringe when I think about it.<br />*Good mews recycled paper smelled horrible out of the bag, was heavy, looked gross in the box, and was not flush-able. It only started to smell worse once my cats used it.

We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.  I always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing.  Oh My Gosh!  This hot chocolate was incredible. When I opened the can to make it, I saw pieces of Candycane candy in the chocolate powder. I made it the way that they suggested, with hot water, not milk.  It was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor.  There were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop.  I am thrilled to see that they carry this on Amazon because I know that the grocery store only carried it for the holidays and the price on Amazon is much less than I paid.

280519	B005OVPKCI	AV6BQVVC1XE4E	Eric L. Fletcher	0	0	5	1337731200	One of my favorite cereals now available from Amazon	While you normally think of hot oatmeal mixes when you think of Quaker, I think of their awesome Oatmeal Squares cereal.  A long time favorite, the super dense smaller squares of cinnamon based heaven are surprisingly good for you too. 46 grams of whole wheat per serving, providing a whopping 20% of your Daily Value for Dietary Fiber.  And unlike many other cereals, the ingredient list is a pleasant surprise.  Whole grain oat flour and then whole wheat flour are the first two ingredients.  And no high fructose corn syrup either, just good ole brown sugar and regular sugar.  Cinnamon and molasses round out the flavor ingredients.  And sugar only makes up 9 grams per serving- the same as the more expensive and worst tasting Kashi Cinnamon Harvest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1YYLW">Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest, 16.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> I bought as a comparison.<br /><br />In fact the Quaker pretty much destroyed the Kashi on the taste test.  It also held up better in milk longer, and the smaller denser squares compared favorably to the bigger looser Kashi squares which crumbled more more easily in the box.  Fiber was a tie, with the Quaker having an extra gram of soluble fiber.  Fat wise the Quaker does have 2.5 grams to 1 gram for the Kashi- but we are still talking 4 and 2% respectively of the Daily Value- so they are both good choices.<br /><br />Downsides- the box is smaller than most at 14.5oz versus 17.5oz for the Kashi.  And its expensive- at nearly $5 a box on Amazon.  But with free delivery and no sales tax its probably close to a wash versus your supermarket. And you will probably eat more than one "serving" per meal, so you can blow through a box quicker than you would think.<br /><br />So one of my favorite cereals with Amazon convenience, now I just would like to see the Amazon price come down a bit more to reflect the quantity we are buying.  But for the cereal itself, I can give an unqualified 5 star rave- its great tasting and good for you to boot.

I would say that diet and eating proper foods works much better than drinking tea made of raspberry leaves, although I am still using it, I hope it is helping." Is what I said after I first bought it. Amazon won't let me change my rating but I was wrong...<br /><br />I began to drink this tea often, Most days of the month. The weeks before my cycle, about when I start to ovulate. I start to drink at least 6 bags a day and I have seen a HUGE IMPROVEMENT in my pain.<br /><br />I have had severe cramping since I started my "woman time" several years ago. This is the first time I have seen relief. While this could do with a combination of things, I can say that there is a signifigant change in the heaviness of my cycle.<br /><br />Another tip, I mix this tea with the Joint Pain tea that Yogi has as well. This has helped to mask the mildly unpleasant flavor of this tea.
435617	B000HDI5O8	A2CGORRQGDEL37	T.C. Owens	7	7	1	1283990400	Good pumpkin, BUT too many heavily dented cans!	I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  "caveat emptor."

The sugar-free part eases your guilt of pouring pudding down your gullet.  But what makes this lemon flavor special?<br /><br />It's one of the best flavors, and I think many or most will agree with that; it's vibrant, comparatively speaking.  But consider mixing it with others!  For example, it really can pick up the rather bland cheesecake flavor and improve on them both.  You'll make at least two packages anyway, right?  So, one of each works.<br /><br />Use your imagination!

My jam always comes out beautifully.  Unfortunately, I ran out of Sure-Jell tonight, and used a packet of Pomona's Universal Pectin that was sitting in my cupboard instead.  BIG mistake.  The jam jelled, all right, but the final consistency was pasty and the brightness of the fruit flavors was totally clouded.  I got pretty much the same results as if I'd thickened my fruit with corn starch.  Ick!  Next time I'll stick with Sure-Jell.

I love the flavor of all of their chews, I am a Ginger freak, I Love the health aspects of the product. Regarding their Packaging, It doesn't matter it they are wrapped in Plastic or Parchment Both styles can be a pain in the but. If they are stored in a cool dry p;ace, I find they are easiest to open, If they are warm to hot, Forget it, you will have a problem with both wrappers due to the nature of the product itself. I actually prefer the Plastic packing to the Parchment double wrap. Just pinch with your fingers just right or left of the center and they open right up. I order 22 pounds at a time, what does that tell you about the product.
